As alleged in the complaint, ABB's subsidiaries made at least $2.7 million in illicit payments in these schemes to obtain contracts that generated more than $100 million in revenues for ABB.  In the Mexican bribery scheme, the SEC alleges that from 1999 through 2004, ABB Network Management (\"ABB NM\"), a business unit within ABB's U.S. subsidiary, ABB, Inc., bribed officials in Mexico to obtain and retain business with two government owned electric utilities, Comision Federal de Electricidad (\"CFE\") and Luz y Fuerza del Centro (\"LyFZ\"). [  ]  The SEC further alleges that from approximately 2000 to 2004 ABB participated in the United Nations Oil for Food Program (the \"Program\").

(\"ABB Jordan\"), ABB Automation, ABB Industrie AC Machines and ABB Solyvent-Ventec (collectively referred to as \"ABB France\"), ABB AG (\"ABB Austria\"), and ABB Elektrik Sanayi AS (\"ABB Turkey\"). The SEC alleges that these subsidiaries developed various schemes to pay secret kickbacks to Iraq to obtain contracts under the Program. ABB's Jordanian subsidiary acted as a conduit for other ABB subsidiaries by making the kickback payments on their behalf.

Alcatel CIT wired more than $18 million to two consultants in Costa Rica, which had been retained by Alcatel Standard, in connection with obtaining business in that country. According to court documents, more than half of this money was then passed on by the consultants to various Costa Rican government officials for assisting Alcatel CIT and Alcatel de Costa Rica in obtaining and retaining business. As part of the scheme, the consultants created phony invoices that they then submitted to Alcatel CIT. According to court documents, senior Alcatel executives approved the retention of and payments to the consultants despite obvious indications that the consultants were performing little or no legitimate work.  In addition, according to court documents, Alcatel Standard hired a consultant in Honduras who was a perfume distributor with no experience in telecommunications. The consultant was retained after being personally selected by the brother of a senior Honduran government official. Alcatel CIT executives knew that a significant portion of the money paid to the consultant would be paid to the family of the senior Honduran government official in exchange for favorable treatment of Alcatel CIT. As a result of these payments, Alcatel CIT was able to retain contracts worth approximately $47 million and from which Alcatel earned $870,000.  In addition, according to court documents, Alcatel Standard retained two consultants on behalf of another Alcatel subsidiary in Taiwan to assist in obtaining an axle counting contract worth approximately $19.2 million. Alcatel and its joint venture paid these two consultants more than $950,000 despite the fact that neither consultant had telecommunications experience. In fact, according to court documents, Alcatel Standard's purpose for hiring the consultants was so that Alcatel SEL could funnel payments through the consultants to Taiwanese legislators who had influence in the award of the contract.

Alcatel-Lucent S.A., Case No. 1:10-cr-20907-PAS (S.D. Fla.), Deferred Prosecution Agreement filed February 22, 2011.)  ICE Petition: In May and June 2011, the Instituto Costarricense de Electriciad (ICE) petitioned the District Court for the Southern District of Florida considering the Alcatel-Lucent SA criminal cases for relief/restitution and to obejct to the Alcatel-Lucent's plea agreement and deferred prosecution agreement with the US Government. ICE petitioned the court to be recognized as a victim and entitled to restitution, pursuant to the Crime Victims' Rights Act (18 USC Section 1651), US Federal Rules on Criminal Procedure and the Mandatory Victim Restitution Act (18 USC Section 3663A).  ICE argued that it had suffered direct and proximate damage from Alcatel-Lucent's conduct and refuted the argument by the US and Alcatel-Lucent (later supported by the court) that it had been a co-conspirator or co-participant in the bribery scheme.  (Sources: US v. Alcatel-Lucent S.A., Case No. 1:10-cr-20907 (S.D. Fla.), Petition for Relief Pursuant to 18 U.S.C.

The US Government's Response to ICE's Petition for Victim Status and Restitution, filed May 23, 2011, argued that \"Under the facts and circumstances in the instant matter, which reflect profound and pervasive corruption at the highest levels of ICE, the government does not believe it is appropriate to consider ICE a victim in these cases. [ ] Moreover, regardless of whether ICE is considered a victim, the government does not believe that restitution should be ordered in this matter, because, under the facts and circumstances present in this case, any restitution calculation woul dbe netirely speculative and would unduly prolong and complicate the sentencing process - something that the law does not support.\"  The US Government cited the involvement of the ICE board members and high level officers in the Alcatel scheme and as legal basis, US v. Lazarenko, 624 F.3d 1247, 1250-52 (9th Cir. 2010) (an individual who is both a victim and a participant in a money-laundering scheme who profited from the conspiracy cannot qualify as a \"victim\" under restitution statutes), and in footnote 8, refuted ICE's contention that the DOJ had stated that foreign governments or instrumentalities could never be victims, much less that that was Department [of Justice] policy. ICE appealed the district court's ruling to the 11th Circuit Appeals Court, but its petition was also denied. The appeals court held that the \"district court did not clearly err in finding that 'Instituto Costarricense de Electricidad' (\"ICE\"), here seeking to be deemed a \"crime victim,\" actually functions as the offenders' coconspirator.  The district court identified the pervasive, constant, and consistent illegal conduct by the \"principals\" (i.e. members of the Board of Directors and management) of ICE, the organization claiming status as a victim under the CVRA.  Neither did the district court err in finding that ICE failed to establish that it was directly and proximately harmed by the offenders' criminal conduct.\" (Sources:  In re: Instituto Costarricense de Electricidad, No. 11-12707-G and No. 11-12708-G (11th Cir.), On Petititon for Writ of Mandamus to the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida filed June 17, 2011 and September 2, 2011 denial of ICE's motion for Petition for Rehearing En Banc; see also Consolidated Opposition of Alcatel-Lucent, S.A., Alcatel-Lucent France, S.A., Alcatel-Lucent Trade International, A.G. and Alcatel Centroamerica, S.A. to Petitions for Writs of Mandamus Pursuant to the Crime Victims Rights Act, 18 U.S.C.

        "Summary": "According to the Press Release issued by the Swiss Office of Attorney General, \"As far as the proceedings were also brought against Alstom SA, based in France, they have been dismissed with regard to the actions in Latvia, Tunisia and Malaysia based on Art. 53 SCC, imposing on the company the costs of the proceedings allotted to Alstom SA in this regard. In the opinion of the OAG, Alstom SA as the senior holding company is responsible in part for the organizational deficiencies identified. However, after payment of CHF 1 m as reparation and bearing the remaining costs of the proceedings by Alstom SA, the OAG refrained from sanctioning Alstom SA in addition to Alstom Network Schweiz AG regarding the established acts of bribery. It did so particularly considering the demonstrated willingness to cooperate and the considerable improvements in the internal compliance procedures before and after the opening of the investigations.Within the proceedings against Alstom Network Schweiz AG and Alstom SA, the OAG in close cooperation with the Federal Criminal Police investigated further twelve projects in the power station sector, divided over all continents. In this regard, it in some part detected additional breaches of internal compliance regulations. Despite considerable investigative efforts however, no additional acts of bribery could be established for the time after article 102 SCC had come into effect. The proceedings against the two defendant Alstom entities for these additionally investigated twelve projects were dismissed due to the lack of any criminal conduct (Art. 319(1)(a) Swiss Code of Criminal Procedure) and due to the lack of criminal liability of the companies prior to October 2003 (Art. 319(1)(b) Swiss Code of Criminal Procedure), without granting compensation and by imposing the costs allotted for this part of the proceedings on the two Alstom companies. [  ]  The amount of CHF 1 m paid by Alstom SA as reparation under Art. 53 SCC was transferred to the International Committee of the Red Cross. One-third of these funds each shall be used in projects of the ICRC in Tunisia, Latvia and Malaysia respectively. The costs allotted for the part of the proceedings resulting in the dismissal amount to about CHF 90,000 and have been imposed on the two Alstom companies for which they are jointly liable.  Due to Alstom renouncing to appeal, this decision also has become legally binding.\" (Source: The Office of the Attorney General Press Release, \"Criminal proceedings against Alstom entities are brought to a close,\" November 22, 2011.)

[   ] The fact that payments were carried out and made by the Defendant on the basis of such consultancy agreements into the accounts of offshore and shell companies both nationally and abroad, i.e. into accounts located outside the project country, meant that there was a higher risk, as a matter of principle not tolerated by internal guidelines, that such payments could be used for bribery or for other illegal purposes.\" (Source: Summary Punishment Order at para 10.)

(1) In Latvia, from 2006 onwards, bribe payments were funnelled to legal entities SIA Energy Consulting (Latvia) and Kenmore OU (Estonia) controlled by Andrejs Livanovics, a former Alstom business development manager for the Baltics but the beneficiaries of the success fees were executives of the state owned company LATVENERGO AS who were decisively involved in decisions related to awarding contracts; (2) in Tunisia, \"consultancy\" payments to companies controlled by Slim CHIBOUB, a son-in-law of the former President of Tunisia; the companies were Roserton Overseas SA (Panama) and Dalmel Trading, Inc. (BVI); and (3) in Malaysia, in connection with the state-licensed Teknologi Tenaga Perlis Consortium Sdtn Bhd, Alstom companies were used as intermediary companies for \"consulting agreements\" for which the beneficiaries were TTPC executives Chee Liang TI and Abdul Hamid PAWANTEH (latter was also a local politician in the constituent state of Perlis where the power station was to be built).  The involved Alstom companies were: in Latvia - Alstom Power Sweden AB and Alstom Hydro Sweden AB; in Tunisia - Alstom Power Centrales; in Malaysia - Alstom Schweiz AG and Alstom power O&M AG.

[ ] According to the non-prosecution agreement, Aon's United Kingdom subsidiary, Aon Limited, administered certain training and education funds in connection with its reinsurance business with Instituto Nacional De Seguros (INS), Costa Rica's state-owned insurance company.   The supposed purpose of the funds was to provide education and training for INS officials.   However, between 1997 and 2005, Aon Limited used a significant portion of the funds to reimburse INS officials for non-training related activity, including travel with spouses to overseas tourist destinations, or for uses that could not be determined from Aon's books and records.   Many of the invoices and other records for trips taken by INS officials did not provide any business purpose for the expenditures, or showed that the expenses were clearly not related to a legitimate business purpose.   As part of the agreement, Aon admitted that Aon Limited's accounting books and records related to the funds, which were consolidated into Aon's books and records, did not accurately and fairly reflect the purpose for which the expenses were incurred.   Aon also admitted that it failed to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls with respect to foreign sales activities sufficient to ensure compliance with the FCPA.\" (Source: US Department of Justice Press Release, \"Aon Corporation Agrees to Pay $1.76 Million Criminal Penalty to Resolve Violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act,\" December 20, 2011.)

Aon will pay a total of approximately $14.5 million in disgorgement and prejudgment interest to the SEC. In a related action, Aon will pay a $1.764 million criminal fine to the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ).  The Commission's complaint alleges that Aon's subsidiaries made over $3.6 million in improper payments to various parties between 1983 and 2007 as a means of obtaining or retaining insurance business in those countries. The complaint alleges that some of the improper payments were made directly or indirectly to foreign government officials who could award business directly to Aon subsidiaries, who were in position to influence others who could award business to Aon subsidiaries, or who could otherwise provide favorable business treatment for the company's interests. The complaint alleges that these payments were not accurately reflected in Aon's books and records, and that Aon failed to maintain an adequate internal control system reasonably designed to detect and prevent the improper payments.  According to the Commission's complaint, the improper payments made by Aon's subsidiaries fall into two general categories: (i) training, travel, and entertainment provided to employees of foreign government-owned clients and third parties; and (ii) payments made to third-party facilitators. Aon subsidiaries made these payments in various countries around the world, including Costa Rica, Egypt, Vietnam, Indonesia, United Arab Emirates, Myanmar, and Bangladesh. The complaint alleges that Aon realized over $11.4 million in profits from these improper payments.\"  The SEC Litigation Release acknowledged the assistance of the UK Financial Services Authority in this matter.

The Final Notice stated that the company qualified for a 30% discount under the FSA's settlement discount scheme and that without the discount the fine would have been GBP 7.5 million. As a result of the systems and controls failings at Aon Limited, this gave rise to unacceptable risk that Aon Ltd could become involved in potentially corrupt payments to win or retain busines.  During the relevant period, 66 suspicious payments amounting to US$2.5 million and EUR 3.4 million were paid to nine \"Overseas Third Parties\" (and a number of other suspicious payments to those Overseas Third Parties were made prior to the 2005, before Aon became regulated by the FSA).  The Final Oder stated that as a result of the suspicious payments, business that may have been secured or retained amounted to approximately US $7.2 million and EUR 1 million. An Explanatory Note of February 27, 2009 to the Final Order noted that while certain payments were made through Aon's Bahraini business (Aon Re Middle East WLL) during the Relevant Period, the Final Notice relates solely to Aon Ltd in the UK and the FSA's investigation did not identify any payments made to Bahraini individuals or companies.

        "Summary": "According to the June 2011 United States Report to the OECD, \"On February 4, 2010, BAE Systems plc (BAES), a multinational defense contractor with headquarters in the United Kingdom, was charged in a one-count criminal information with conspiracy to defraud the United States by impairing and impeding its lawful functions, to make false statements about its FCPA compliance program, and to violate the Arms Export Control Act (AECA) and International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR). These charges alleged that from 2000 to 2002, BAES represented to various U.S. government agencies, including the Departments of Defense and Justice, that it would create and implement policies and procedures to ensure its compliance with the anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA, as well as similar, foreign laws implementing the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Anti-bribery Convention.  In pleading guilty, BAES acknowledged that, despite its representations to the U.S. government to the contrary, BAES knowingly and willfully failed to create sufficient compliance mechanisms to ensure compliance with these legal prohibitions on foreign bribery. More specifically, BAES admitted that it regularly used and encouraged the establishment of shell companies and third party intermediaries to assist in securing sales of defense articles. BAES admitted that, from May 2001 onward, it made a series of substantial payments to these shell companies and third party intermediaries that were not subjected to the degree of scrutiny and review to which BAES told the U.S. government the payments would be subjected, even though BAES was aware there was a high probability that part of some of the payments would be used to ensure that BAES was favored in foreign government decisions regarding the purchase of defense articles. In addition, BAES admitted that, as part of the conspiracy, it knowingly and willfully failed to identify commissions paid to third parties for assistance in soliciting, promoting or otherwise securing sales of defense articles, in violation of the AECA and ITAR.\" (Source:  US Report to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, \"Steps taken to implement and enforce the OECD Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions,\" Information as of May 31, 2011, BAE Systems Plc Case Summary at 50-51.)

KPMG-SSH agreed to make the illicit payment to influence the Indonesian tax official to reduce a tax assessment for PTEC from $3.2 million to $270,000. Harsono advised KPMG-SSH personnel that if Baker Hughes represented directly to KPMG-SSH, not through PTEC, that it wanted KPMG-SSH to make the illicit payment, KPMG-SSH would be willing to pay the Indonesian tax official. To conceal the improper payment, Harsono agreed with KPMG-SSH personnel that KPMG-SSH should generate an invoice that would include money for the payment to the Indonesian tax official and for KPMG-SSH's fees for services rendered. The false invoice, although purporting to be for professional services rendered, in reality represented $75,000 to be paid to an Indonesian tax official, and the remainder for KPMG-SSH's actual fees and applicable taxes. After receiving the invoice, PTEC paid KPMG-SSH $143,000 and improperly entered the transaction on its books and records as payment for professional services rendered.

Baker Hughes has agreed to pay more than $23 million in disgorgement and prejudgment interest for these violations and to pay a civil penalty of $10 million for violating a 2001 Commission cease-and-desist Order prohibiting violations of the books and records and internal controls provisions of the FCPA.  [  ] The SEC's complaint alleges that Baker Hughes paid approximately $5.2 million to two agents while knowing that some or all of the money was intended to bribe government officials, specifically officials of State-owned companies, in Kazakhstan. The complaint alleges that one agent was hired in September 2000 on the understanding that Kazakhoil, Kazakhstan's national oil company at that time, had demanded that the agent be hired to influence senior level employees of Kazakhoil to approve the award of business to the company. [  ] Baker Hughes, the complaint alleges, paid the agent $4.1 million to its bank account in London but received no identifiable services from the agent. The complaint also alleges that in 1998 Baker Hughes retained a second agent in connection with the award of a large chemical contract with KazTransOil, the national oil transportation operator of Kazakhstan. Between 1998 and 1999, Baker Hughes paid over $1 million to the agent's Swiss bank account, despite a company employee knowing by December 1998 that the agent's representative was a high-ranking executive of KazTransOil.  The SEC's complaint against Baker Hughes also alleges violations of the books and records and internal controls provisions of the FCPA in Nigeria, Angola, Indonesia, Russia, Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan.

According to the Shearman and Sterling FCPA Digest, the case is noteworthy for its jurisdictional reach, as Mr. Fearnley was a British citizen residing in Kazakhstan.  According to the Default Judgment Order in his case, Mr. Fearnley did not respond to the complaint, and on January 26, 2010, was ordered to pay $5,000 in disgorgement of profits and $7,635.51 in prejudgment interest.

Within months of Ball's acquisition of Fornamental, two Fornamental executives, the then-Fornamental President and then-Fornamental Vice President of Institutional Affairs - authorized improper payments to Argentine officials. Specifically, in the period between July 2006 and October 2007, Fornamental's senior officers authorized at least ten unlawful payments totaling approximately $106,749 to Argentine government officials. These payments were intended to induce government custom officials to circumvent Argentine laws prohibiting the importation of prohibited used machinery, equipment and parts and also to secure the exportation of raw materials at reduced tariffs.Fornamental's bribes were funneled through a third party customs agent, who often included the bribes on invoices sent to the company. The bribes often appeared on the invoices as separate line items described inaccurately as \"fees for customs assistance \"customs advisory services,\" \"verification charge,\" or simply \"fees.\"  According to the SEC's order, the true nature of these payments was then mischaracterized as ordinary business expenses on Fornamental's books and records.\" (Source: US Report to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, \"Steps taken to implement and enforce the OECD Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions,\" Information as of May 31, 2011, Ball Corporation Case Summary, at 19-20.)",

According to the SEC's Complaint, between September 1997 and August 2000, former senior management of BellSouth's Venezuelan subsidiary, Telcel, C.A. (Telcel), authorized payments totaling approximately $10.8 million to six offshore companies and improperly recorded the disbursements in Telcel's books and records, based on fictitious invoices, as bona fide services. Telcel's internal controls failed to detect the unsubstantiated payments for a period of at least two years. As an additional consequence of this control deficiency, the Complaint alleged that BellSouth was unable to reconstruct the circumstances or purpose of the Telcel payments, or determine the identity of their ultimate recipients. Telcel was Venezuela's leading wireless provider, contributing more revenue to BellSouth's Latin American Group segment than any other Latin American BellSouth operation. In addition, the SEC charged that between October 1998 and June 1999, BellSouth's Nicaraguan subsidiary, Telefonia Celular de Nicaragua, S.A.'s (Telefonia), improperly recorded payments to the wife of the Nicaraguan legislator who was the chairman of the Nicaraguan legislative committee with oversight of Nicaraguan telecommunications.\" (Source: US Report to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, \"Steps taken to implement and enforce the OECD Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions,\" Information as of May 31, 2011, BellSouth Corporation Case,  at 127-128.)

The two-count information charges Marubeni with one count of conspiracy and one count of aiding and abetting violations of the FCPA. Marubeni is a Japanese trading company headquartered in Tokyo.  According to court documents, Marubeni was hired as an agent by the four-company TSKJ joint venture to help TSKJ obtain and retain EPC contracts to build liquefied natural gas (LNG) facilities on Bonny Island, Nigeria, by offering to pay and paying bribes to Nigerian government officials, among other means. TSKJ was comprised of Technip S.A., Snamprogetti Netherlands B.V., Kellogg Brown & Root Inc. (KBR) and JGC Corporation. Between 1995 and 2004, TSKJ was awarded four EPC contracts, valued at more than $6 billion, by Nigeria LNG Ltd. to build the LNG facilities on Bonny Island. The government-owned Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation was the largest shareholder of NLNG, owning 49 percent of the company. According to court documents, to assist in obtaining and retaining the EPC contracts, the joint venture hired two agents -- Marubeni and Jeffrey Tesler, a U.K. solicitor -- to pay bribes to a wide range of Nigerian government officials. The joint venture hired Tesler as a consultant to pay bribes to high-level Nigerian government officials, including top-level executive branch officials, and hired Marubeni to pay bribes to lower-level Nigerian government officials. At crucial junctures preceding the award of EPC contracts, a number of co-conspirators, including on two occasions an employee of Marubeni, met with successive holders of a top-level office in the executive branch of the Nigerian government to ask the office holders to designate a representative with whom TSKJ should negotiate bribes to Nigerian government officials. TSKJ paid approximately $132 million to a Gibraltar corporation controlled by Tesler and $51 million to Marubeni during the course of the bribery scheme and intended for these payments to be used, in part, for bribes to Nigerian government officials.

According to the SEC?s complaint, filed today in federal district court in Washington, D.C., from approximately January 2002 through July 2007, GSF made illegal payments to officials of the Nigerian Customs Service (NCS), through companies acting as customs brokers for GSF. In November 2007, GSF, an oil and gas drilling services company, merged with a subsidiary of Transocean Inc. In December 2008, the listed company became Transocean Ltd. [  ]  The SEC alleges that GSF [GlobalSantaFe Corp], through its customs brokers, made other suspicious payments, some characterized as \"interventions,\" to Nigerian customs officials. In addition, GSF similarly made a number of suspicious payments to government officials in Gabon, Angola, and Equatorial Guinea. These payments were described on invoices as, for example, \"customs vacation,\" \"customs escort,\" \"costs extra police to obtain visa,\" \"official dues,\" and \"authorities fees.\"  None of the payments were accurately reflected in GSF's books and records, nor was GSF's system of internal accounting controls adequate at the time to detect and prevent these illegal payments.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, GSF has consented to the entry of a court order permanently enjoining it from violating the anti-bribery and record keeping and internal controls provisions in Section 30A and Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act.

As part of the settlement, Noble will pay $5,576,998 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest.  [ ]   The Commission's complaint, filed today in federal court in Houston, alleges that from January 2003 through May 2007, Noble authorized payments by its Nigerian subsidiary to its customs agent, believing that the agent would give portions of the payments to Nigerian government officials to induce them to grant temporary importation permits (TIPs) and TIP extensions for Noble's drilling rigs. Although Noble was required to move its rigs out of Nigeria when TIPs and any extensions had expired, it did not do so in order to avoid the costs of moving the rigs, the potential loss of profits, and the break in performance of rigs under contract. Noble used the customs agents to submit false documents to Nigerian Customs Service showing export and re-import of its drilling rigs when in fact the rigs never moved. Noble paid its customs agents to present these false documents to the Nigeria Customs Service (NCS) and, through the customs agents, made improper payments to officials of the NCS to process the false documents and issue new TIPS. Noble obtained eight TIPs with false documentation.\" (Source:  US Securities and Exchange Commission, Litigation Release No. 21728/ November 4, 2010, Securities and Exchange Commission v.

(PWT), a global freight forwarding and logistics services provider based in Basel, Switzerland, with violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) by bribing foreign officials around the world on behalf of its customers. The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Houston, alleges that from 2002 through 2007 Panalpina, Inc. (Panalpina), in concert with other PWT subsidiaries and affiliates (Panalpina Group), bribed government officials in countries including Nigeria, Angola, Brazil, Russia, and Kazakhstan. The bribes were paid by Panalpina to obtain preferential customs, duties, and import treatment for its customers in connection with international freight shipments. Although PWT, Panalpina, and the Panalpina Group are not issuers for purposes of the FCPA, many of their customers are. By paying bribes on behalf of issuers, Panalpina both violated and aided and abetted violations of the FCPA.  To settle the SEC's charges, Panalpina will pay $11,329,369. [ ]  The complaint alleges that although the bribery schemes varied, most shared several similarities. The customers often used Panalpina or other Panalpina Group companies to ship goods internationally or sought Panalpina's assistance in obtaining customs or logistics services in the country to which goods were shipped. For various reasons --including delayed departures, insufficient or incorrect documentation, the nature of the goods being shipped and imported, or the refusal of local government officials to provide services without unofficial payments -- Panalpina's customers sometimes faced delays in importing goods. In other cases, Panalpina's customers sought to avoid local customs duties or inspection requirements or otherwise sought to import goods in circumvention of local law. In order to secure the importation of goods under these circumstances, Panalpina's customers often authorized Panalpina and other Panalpina Group companies to bribe foreign officials.  The complaint further alleges that Panalpina Group companies invoiced Panalpina's customers for the bribes. The invoices, which contained both legitimate and illegitimate charges, concealed the bribes by inaccurately referring to them as \"local processing,\" \"special intervention,\" \"special handing,\" and other seemingly legitimate fees. Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Panalpina consented to the entry of a final judgment ordering disgorgement and permanently enjoining it from violating the FCPA's anti-bribery provisions and aiding and abetting violations of the FCPA's books and records and internal controls provisions. These provisions are codified as Sections 30A, 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The proposed settlement is subject to court approval.",

        "Summary": "According to the June 2011 United States Report to the OECD, \"On December 4, 2009, two former executives of a Florida-based telecommunications company, the president of a Florida-based intermediary company, and two former Haitian government officials were charged in an indictment for their alleged roles in a foreign bribery, wire fraud, and money laundering scheme that lasted from at least November 2001 through March 2005. Joel Esquenazi, the former president of the telecommunications company; Carlos Rodriguez, the former executive vice-president of the telecommunications company; Marguerite Grandison, the former president of Telecom Consulting Services Corp.; Robert Antoine, a former director of international relations at the Republic of Haiti?s state-owned national telecommunications company, Telecommunications D'Haiti (Haiti Teleco); and Jean Rene Duperval, another former director of international relations at Haiti Teleco, were charged in connection with a scheme whereby the telecommunications company paid more than $800,000 to shell companies, including Grandison's Telecom Consulting Services Corp., to be used for bribes to foreign officials of Haiti Teleco. The purpose of these bribes was to obtain various business advantages from the Haitian officials for the telecommunications company, including issuing preferred telecommunications rates, reducing the number of minutes for which payment was owed, and giving a variety of credits toward owed sums, as well as to defraud the Republic of Haiti of revenue.Previously, on April 22, 2009, Juan Diaz, the president of J.D. Locator Services Inc., a Florida-based intermediary, and Antonio Perez, the former controller of the Florida-based telecommunications company, were charged in connection with their roles in the alleged foreign bribery scheme. According to court documents, from 1998 to 2003, Diaz and Perez conspired to make \"side payments\" totaling $1 million to the Haitian government officials through a shell company belonging to Diaz, all on behalf of the Florida-based telecommunications company.On February 1, 2010, Jean Fourcand, the president of Fourcand Enterprises, Inc., another intermediary company, was charged in a one-count criminal information with engaging in monetary transactions involving property derived from the scheme to bribe the former Haitian government officials. Specifically, between November 2001 and August 2002, Fourcand received funds originating from this and other U.S. telecommunications companies for the benefit of Robert Antoine.

The SEC's administrative order alleged that Bristow violated the anti-bribery, internal controls, and books and records provisions of the FCPA as a consequence of the actions of two of its subsidiaries in Nigeria.  According to the SEC's administrative filing, since at least 2003 and through approximately the end of 2004, Bristow Group's Nigerian affiliate, Pan African Airlines Nigeria Ltd. (PAAN), made improper payments totaling $423,000 to employees of the governments of two Nigerian states to influence them to improperly reduce the amount of expatriate employment taxes payable by PAAN to the respective Nigerian state governments. At the end of each year, PAAN was subject to an expatriate \"Pay As You Earn\" (PAYE) tax, which was assessed on the salaries of PAAN employees by the government of each Nigerian state where PAAN operated. PAAN then negotiated with government tax officials to lower the amount assessed. In each instance, the PAYE tax demand amount was lowered and a separate cash payment for the tax officials was negotiated. Once PAAN paid the state government and the tax officials, each state government provided PAAN with a receipt reflecting only the amount payable to the state government. All together, PAAN secured an $854,000 reduction in its PAYE tax liability in exchange for these improper payments.\r\nDuring that same time period, Bristow Group underreported PAAN and another Bristow Group Nigerian affiliate's payroll expenses to certain Nigerian state governments. As a result, Bristow Group's periodic reports filed with the SEC did not accurately reflect certain of the company's payroll-related expenses. Accordingly, the SEC's administrative order found that during this time period, Bristow Group had both lacked sufficient internal accounting controls and mischaracterized the payments as legitimate payroll expenses on its books and records.\" (Source: US Report to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, \"Steps taken to implement and enforce the OECD Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions,\" Information as of May 31, 2011, Bristow Group Inc.Case,  at 96-97.)

[  ]   The SEC's complaint, filed in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, alleges that Daimler used bribes to further government sales in such countries as Russia, China, Vietnam, Nigeria, Hungary, Latvia, Croatia, and Bosnia. Among other means, Daimler used dozens of ledger accounts, known internally as \"interne Fremdkonten\" or \"internal third party accounts\" to maintain credit balances for the benefit of government officials. These credit balances were controlled by Daimler subsidiaries or outside third parties, including foreign government officials or Daimler's dealers, distributors or other agents who were at times used as intermediaries to make payments to foreign government officials. The accounts were funded through several bogus pricing mechanisms, such as \"price surcharges,\" \"price inclusions,\" or excessive commissions. Daimler also used artificial discounts or rebates on sales contracts to effectuate bribes. In those instances, all or a portion of the discount was kicked back through a ledger account to a foreign government official, rather than credited to the purchasing government customer.\" (Source:  US Securities and Exchange Commission Press Release, \"SEC Charges Daimler AG with Global Bribery,\" April 1, 2010.)\r\n\r\n",

        "Summary": "According to the US Department of Justice Press Release, \"Magyar Telekom Plc., a Hungarian telecommunications company, and Deutsche Telekom AG, a German telecommunications company and majority owner of Magyar Telekom, have agreed to pay a combined $63.9 million criminal penalty to resolve a Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) investigation into activities by Magyar Telekom and its subsidiaries in Macedonia and Montenegro. [ ]  The department filed a criminal information against Magyar Telekom and a two-year deferred prosecution agreement in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia today.   The three-count information charges Magyar Telekom with one count of violating the anti-bribery provision of the FCPA and two counts of violating the books and records provisions of the FCPA.   At the time of the charged conduct, Magyar Telekom's American Depository Receipts (ADRs) traded on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).   As part of the deferred prosecution agreement, Magyar Telekom agreed to pay a $59.6 million penalty for its illegal activity [  ]    \r\n\r\nAccording to court documents, Magyar Telekom's scheme in Macedonia stemmed from potential legal changes being made to the telecommunications market in that country.    In early 2005, the Macedonian government tried to liberalize the Macedonian telecommunications market in a way that Magyar Telekom deemed detrimental to its Macedonian subsidiary, Makedonski Telekommunikacii AD Skopje (MakTel).   Throughout the late winter and spring of 2005, Magyar Telekom executives, with the help of Greek intermediaries, lobbied Macedonian government officials to prevent the implementation of the new telecommunications laws and regulations. [ ]  According to court documents, in order to secure the benefits in the protocol of cooperation, the Magyar Telekom executives engaged in a course of conduct with consultants, intermediaries and other third parties, including through sham consultancy contracts with entities owned and controlled by a Greek intermediary, to pay \u20ac4.875 (approximately $6 million) under circumstances in which they knew, or were aware of a high probability that circumstances existed in which, all or part of such payment would be passed on to Macedonian officials.   The sham contracts were recorded as legitimate on MakTel's books and records, which were consolidated into Magyar Telekom's financials.   Deutsche Telekom, which owned approximately 60 percent of Magyar Telekom, reported in the results of Magyar Telekom's operations in its consolidated financial statements.    \r\n\r\n Additionally, the criminal information charges Magyar Telekom with falsifying its books and records in regard to its activity in Montenegro.   According to the court filing, Magyar Telekom made improper payments in connection with its acquisition of a state-owned telecommunications company in Montenegro.   These payments were documented on Magyar Telekom's books and records through the execution of four bogus contracts.   For example, two of the contracts were backdated and concealed the true counterparties, and no legitimate services were provided under the contracts even though the contracts were for \u20ac4.47 million.\r\n\r\nThe department today also entered into a two-year non-prosecution agreement with Magyar Telekom's parent company, Deutsche Telekom, for its failure to keep books and records that accurately detailed the activities of Magyar Telekom.   Deutsche Telekom, which is headquartered in Germany, agreed to pay a $4.36 million penalty in connection with the inaccurate books and records.\"  (Source: US Department of Justice Press Release, Magyar Telekom and Deutsche Telekom Resolve Foreign Corrupt Practices Act Investigation and Agree to Pay Nearly $64 Million in Combined Criminal Penalties,\" December 29, 2011.)",

The SEC alleges that three senior executives at Magyar Telekom Plc. orchestrated, approved, and executed a plan to bribe Macedonian officials in 2005 and 2006 to prevent the introduction of a new competitor and gain other regulatory benefits. Magyar Telekom's subsidiaries in Macedonia made illegal payments of approximately $6 million under the guise of bogus consulting and marketing contracts. The same executives orchestrated a second scheme in 2005 in Montenegro related to Magyar Telekom's acquisition of the state-owned telecommunications company there. Magyar Telekom paid approximately $9 million through four sham contracts to funnel money to government officials in Montenegro. Magyar Telekom's parent company Deutsche Telekom AG also is charged with books and records and internal controls violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA).\" (Source:  US Securities and Exchange Commission, Litigation Release No. 22213 / December 29, 2011, SEC v.

        "Summary": "According to the US Department of Justice Press Release, \"Magyar Telekom Plc., a Hungarian telecommunications company, and Deutsche Telekom AG, a German telecommunications company and majority owner of Magyar Telekom, have agreed to pay a combined $63.9 million criminal penalty to resolve a Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) investigation into activities by Magyar Telekom and its subsidiaries in Macedonia and Montenegro. [ ]  The department filed a criminal information against Magyar Telekom and a two-year deferred prosecution agreement in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia today.   The three-count information charges Magyar Telekom with one count of violating the anti-bribery provision of the FCPA and two counts of violating the books and records provisions of the FCPA.   At the time of the charged conduct, Magyar Telekom's American Depository Receipts (ADRs) traded on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).   As part of the deferred prosecution agreement, Magyar Telekom agreed to pay a $59.6 million penalty for its illegal activity [  ]    \r\n\r\nAccording to court documents, Magyar Telekom's scheme in Macedonia stemmed from potential legal changes being made to the telecommunications market in that country.    In early 2005, the Macedonian government tried to liberalize the Macedonian telecommunications market in a way that Magyar Telekom deemed detrimental to its Macedonian subsidiary, Makedonski Telekommunikacii AD Skopje (MakTel).   Throughout the late winter and spring of 2005, Magyar Telekom executives, with the help of Greek intermediaries, lobbied Macedonian government officials to prevent the implementation of the new telecommunications laws and regulations. [ ]  According to court documents, in order to secure the benefits in the protocol of cooperation, the Magyar Telekom executives engaged in a course of conduct with consultants, intermediaries and other third parties, including through sham consultancy contracts with entities owned and controlled by a Greek intermediary, to pay \u20ac4.875 (approximately $6 million) under circumstances in which they knew, or were aware of a high probability that circumstances existed in which, all or part of such payment would be passed on to Macedonian officials.   The sham contracts were recorded as legitimate on MakTel's books and records, which were consolidated into Magyar Telekom?s financials.   Deutsche Telekom, which owned approximately 60 percent of Magyar Telekom, reported in the results of Magyar Telekom's operations in its consolidated financial statements.    \r\n\r\n Additionally, the criminal information charges Magyar Telekom with falsifying its books and records in regard to its activity in Montenegro.   According to the court filing, Magyar Telekom made improper payments in connection with its acquisition of a state-owned telecommunications company in Montenegro.   These payments were documented on Magyar Telekom's books and records through the execution of four bogus contracts.   For example, two of the contracts were backdated and concealed the true counterparties, and no legitimate services were provided under the contracts even though the contracts were for \u20ac4.47 million.\r\n\r\nThe department today also entered into a two-year non-prosecution agreement with Magyar Telekom's parent company, Deutsche Telekom, for its failure to keep books and records that accurately detailed the activities of Magyar Telekom.   Deutsche Telekom, which is headquartered in Germany, agreed to pay a $4.36 million penalty in connection with the inaccurate books and records. [ ]  Significant assistance was provided by the FBI Washington Field Office?s dedicated FCPA squad, the SEC Division of Enforcement, the Criminal Division's Office of International Affairs and international legal partners in Switzerland, Germany, Greece, Hungary and the Republic of Macedonia.

The officials were responsible for purchasing or authorizing the sale of its beverages in India, and increased sales from these payments yielded more than $11 million in profit for the company.  The SEC found that from 2004 to mid-2008, Diageo paid approximately $12,000 per month -- totaling nearly $600,000 -- to retain the consulting services of a Thai government and political party official. This official lobbied other high-ranking Thai government officials extensively on Diageo?s behalf in connection with pending multi-million dollar tax and customs disputes, contributing to Diageo's receipt of certain favorable decisions by the Thai government.  According to the SEC's order, Diageo paid 100 million in Korean currency (more than $86,000 in U.S. dollars) to a customs official in South Korea as a reward for his role in the government's decision to grant Diageo significant tax rebates. Diageo also improperly paid travel and entertainment expenses for South Korean customs and other government officials involved in these tax negotiations. Separately, Diageo routinely made hundreds of gift payments to South Korean military officials in order to obtain and retain liquor business. [  ] Without admitting or denying the findings, Diageo agreed to cease and desist from further violations and pay $11,306,081 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest of $2,067,739, and a financial penalty of $3 million.\" (Source: US Securities and Exchange Commission Press Release, \"SEC Charges Liquor Giant Diageo with FCPA Violations,\" July 27, 2011.)",

Meza, formerly the Director of Asia-Pacific Sales for Faro Technologies, Inc. (\"Faro\"), a software development and manufacturing company. The Commission's complaint alleges that Meza authorized bribery payments to employees of Chinese state-owned companies in order to obtain contracts, and that in order to conceal the bribes Meza instructed that account entries be altered. The Commission charged Meza with violations of the anti-bribery, books and records and internal control provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\"FCPA\"), and with aiding and abetting Faro's violations of the anti-bribery, books and records and internal control provisions of the FCPA.  The Commission's complaint alleges that beginning in 2004, Meza authorized a former employee of Faro's subsidiary, Faro Shanghai Co., Ltd. (\"Faro-China\"), to make the improper payments. The complaint alleges that Meza's actions resulted in Faro-China's payment of $444,492 in bribes during the period 2004 through 2006, generating approximately $4.5 million in sales and approximately $1.4 million in net profit.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Meza has consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining him from violating Sections 30A and 13(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1, and from aiding and abetting violations of Sections 30A, 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act.

(Fiat), an Italian corporation based in Turin, Italy, were charged in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia in connection with a scheme to pay bribes to Iraqi government officials in order to win contracts under the U.N. Oil-for-Food Program (OFFP). Two Fiat subsidiaries, Iveco S.p.A. (Iveco) and CNH Italia S.p.A.

(CNH France), was charged with one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud. The SEC simultaneously filed a civil complaint against Fiat and CNH Global N.V., alleging that Fiat and its subsidiaries violated the books and records and internal controls provisions of the FCPA in relation to the same conduct.  These charges stemmed from a series of improper payments made by Fiat to Iraqi government officials in order to obtain contracts with Iraqi ministries to provide industrial pumps, gears, and other equipment. According to court documents, between 2000 and 2002, Iveco, CNH Italia, and CNH France paid a total of approximately $4.4 million in kickbacks (referred to as \"after sales service fees\" (ASSFs)) to the Iraqi government by inflating the price of contracts by 10 percent before submitting the contracts to the U.N. for approval, and concealed from the U.N. the fact that the price contained a kickback to the Iraqi government.

Flowserve is a Texas-based manufacturer of pumps, valves, seals, and related automation and services to the power, oil, gas, and chemical industries. The Commission's complaint alleges that from 2001 through 2003, two of Flowserve's subsidiaries entered into a total of twenty contracts in which $646,488 in kickback payments were made and another $173,758 were authorized in connection with sales of industrial equipment to Iraqi government entities under the U.N. Oil for Food Program (the \"Program\"). The kickbacks were characterized as \"after-sales service fees\" (\"ASSFs\"), but no bona fide services were performed. The Program was intended to provide humanitarian relief for the Iraqi population, which faced severe hardship under international trade sanctions. The Program allowed the Iraqi government to purchase humanitarian goods through a U.N. escrow account. The kickbacks paid by Flowserve's subsidiaries diverted funds out of the escrow account and into an Iraqi slush fund. The contracts submitted to the U.N. did not disclose that the illicit payments were included in the inflated contract prices. [  ] Flowserve, without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commission's complaint, consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining it from future violations of Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, ordering it to disgorge $2,720,861, in profits, plus $853,364 in pre-judgment interest, and to pay a civil penalty of $3,000,000.

The information charges that Flowserve Pompes engaged in a conspiracy to commit wire fraud and to violate the books and records provisions of the FCPA in connection with a scheme to pay kickbacks to the Iraqi government under the United Nations Oil for Food Program (OFFP). The SEC's civil complaint charges Flowserve with violating the books and records and internal controls provisions of the FCPA in connection with the same underlying conduct.  According to documents filed in the criminal and civil cases, the French and Dutch subsidiaries of Flowserve [ ] paid or promised to pay approximately $820,246 from 2001 to 2003 in connection with the sale of industrial equipment to the Iraqi government. Flowserve Pompes, Flowserve's French subsidiary, concealed illegal payments to the Iraqi government totaling $604,651 through a Jordanian entity that was its exclusive agent for Iraqi contracts. These payments were made to assist Flowserve Pompes in obtaining fifteen contracts for the sale of large-scale water pumps and spare parts for use in Iraqi oil refineries. Flowserve Pompes also agreed to, but did not ultimately make, an additional $173,758 in improper payments pursuant to four additional contracts, as delivery under these four contracts had not been completed by the time of the U.S. invasion of Iraq in March 2003. Senior officials at Flowserve Pompes, including its President, allegedly developed different false cover stories to conceal these kickback payments in the company's internal accounting records.  According to the SEC's complaint, Flowserve's Dutch Subsidiary, Flowserve B.V., also entered into one contract involving an improper kickback under the OFFP. Specifically, Flowserve B.V. paid $41,836 in kickbacks to Iraqi officials in order to obtain a contract to supply water pump spare parts to the Iraqi government-owned South Gas Company.\"  (Source: US Report to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, \"Steps taken to implement and enforce the OECD Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions,\" Information as of May 31, 2011, Flowserve Corporation Case Summary at 83-84.)",

Nico, 47, of Palm Harbor, Florida, has agreed to plead guilty to the wire fraud charge contained in a criminal information that was filed at U.S. District Court in Birmingham, Alabama. In addition, former HealthSouth Executive Vice President Thomas Carman, 52, of Birmingham, has agreed to plead guilty to a separate criminal information charging him with making a false statement to the FBI. [  ] HealthSouth was a corporation organized under the laws of the State of Delaware with its headquarters in Birmingham, Alabama. [ ] The charges against Nico and Carman stem from HealthSouth's agreement to provide staffing and management services for a 450-bed hospital in Saudi Arabia. Under HealthSouth's contract with a Saudi foundation which built and owned the hospital, HealthSouth was to receive $10 million annually over a five-year term.  According to the criminal informations, the Saudi foundation's director general solicited a $1 million payment from HealthSouth, ostensibly as a \"finders fee.\"  Against the advice of counsel, HealthSouth allegedly agreed to pay the Saudi foundation's director general the sum of $500,000 per year for a five-year period in return for his agreement to execute the contract on behalf of the Saudi foundation. In order to conceal the true nature of the scheme, HealthSouth officers, including Nico and Carman, allegedly arranged for the foundation's director general to execute a bogus consulting contract with a HealthSouth-affiliated entity in Australia. Until the scheme was detected in 2003, HealthSouth paid the amounts due under this phony consulting contract by wiring them to Australia, where they were subsequently wired to the foundation's director general in Saudi Arabia, according to the charges. The HealthSouth officers allegedly undertook this conduct despite the fact that they had been specifically advised beforehand by an attorney retained by HealthSouth that such conduct would amount to a violation of federal criminal law.  The criminal information against Nico charges that he violated his duty of honest services to HealthSouth by accepting a kickback from the foundation's director general whereby Nico received $125,000 per year from the $500,000 paid to the foundation's director general. Under this agreement, Nico received a total of $375,000 in undisclosed payments. In addition, Nico received $631,502 from HealthSouth as payment of a bonus he demanded based his claim that he had performed exemplary service for the company in securing and maintaining the contract with the Saudi foundation, and that he had not received any compensation for that service. Nico has agreed to forfeit $1,005,602, the total amount he received from the foundation's director general and as payment of the bonus from HealthSouth.  The criminal information against Carman charges that he made a false statement to the FBI when he claimed during an interview that the consulting contract with the foundation's director general was intended to be a legitimate arrangement under which real services were to be provided.\" (Source:  US Department of Justice Press Release, \"Former HealthSouth Officers Charged in Fraud Conspiracy involving Saudi Hospitals,\" March 2, 2004.)",

        "Summary": "According to the US Securities and Exchange Commission Litigation Release, on August 5, 2010, the Commission filed a settled complaint which alleged that \"David P. Turner, a former Business Director at Innospec, Inc., and Ousama M. Naaman, Innospec's agent in Iraq, with violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) by paying bribes to numerous government officials to obtain and retain business.The SEC's complaint alleges that: Turner and Naaman engaged in widespread bribery of Iraqi government officials to obtain contracts under the United Nations Oil for Food Program, and in order to continue selling Tetra Ethyl Lean (TEL) to Iraq after the Oil for Food Program ended. Turner also violated the FCPA by paying bribes to Indonesian officials to sell TEL to Indonesian state owned oil companies.  From 2000 to 2008, Innospec, Inc., a manufacturer and distributor of fuel additives and specialty chemicals, routinely paid bribes to government officials in Iraq and Indonesia to sell TEL. The bribery activities in Iraq began with Innospec's participation in the United Nations (\"UN\") Oil for Food Program in 2001, and extended all the way until at least 2008. Turner, the Business Director of Innospec's TEL group, and Naaman, Innospec's agent, both actively participated in the bribery and kickback schemes in Iraq. Innospec also paid bribes to government officials in Indonesia beginning as early as 2000, and continued until 2005, when Indonesia's need for TEL ended. Turner actively participated in the bribery scheme in Indonesia. In all, Innospec made illicit payments of over $6.3 million and promised an additional $2.8 million in illicit payments to Iraqi ministries and government officials as well as Indonesian government officials. The contracts that Innospec obtained in exchange for the bribes were worth approximately $176 million.  Naaman paid kickbacks to Iraq on Innospec's behalf so that Innospec could obtain five Oil-for-Food Program contracts for the sale of TEL to the Iraqi Ministry of Oil and its component oil refineries. Naaman aided Innospec in obtaining the Oil for Food contracts by paying kickbacks equaling 10 percent of the contract value on three of the contracts. When the Oil-for-Food Program ended shortly before Innospec was to pay promised kickbacks on the two remaining contracts, Innospec kept the promised payments as part of its profit. [  ] After the Oil for Food Program ended in late 2003, Turner and Naaman paid bribes to Iraqi officials in order to secure TEL business contracts from Iraq. Turner and senior officials at Innospec directed and approved the bribery payments. From at least 2004 through 2008, Innospec made payments totaling approximately $1,610,327 and promised an additional $884,480. In one e-mail, Naaman informed management, including Turner, that Iraqi officials were demanding a 2% kickback related to one TEL order. [  ]  Turner confirmed that the requested kickback would be paid through an additional 2% \"commission\" to Naaman.  Turner and senior officials at Innospec also directed Naaman to pay a bribe of $155,000 to Iraqi officials to ensure the failure of a 2006 field trial test of MMT, a fuel product manufactured by a competitor of Innospec. Turner and other Innospec officials also authorized payments, through Naaman, to fund lavish trips for Iraqi officials [ ] and Turner also arranged for Naaman to pay thousands of dollars in cash to Iraqi officials for \"pocket money\" on trips funded by Innospec.\"  The Litigation Release also noted that \"Naaman will disgorge $810,076 plus prejudgment interest of $67,030, and pay a civil penalty of $438,038, which will be deemed satisfied by a criminal order requiring Naaman to pay a criminal fine that is at least equal to the civil penalty amount. After his extradition to the United States, Naaman cooperated..\"  (Source:  US Securities and Exchange Commission Litigation Release No. 21615 / August 5, 2010, \"SEC Files Settled Charges Against David P.

From 2001 to 2003, acting on behalf of Innospec, Naaman offered and paid 10 percent kickbacks to the then Iraqi government in exchange for five contracts under the OFFP.   Naaman negotiated the contracts, including a 10 percent increase in the price to cover the kickback, and routed the funds to Iraqi government accounts in the Middle East.   Innospec inflated its prices in contracts approved by the OFFP to cover the cost of the kickbacks.  Naaman also admitted that from 2004 to 2008, he paid and promised to pay more than $3 million in bribes, in the form of cash, as well as travel, gifts and entertainment, to officials of the Iraqi Ministry of Oil and the Trade Bank of Iraq to secure sales of tetraethyl lead in Iraq, as well as to secure more favorable exchange rates on the contracts.

In the course of these transactions, Pillor received e-mail messages from his Asian regional sales manager that suggested that InVision's overseas sales agents and distributors intended to make improper payments or other gifts to foreign government officials, in violation of the FCPA. InVision subsequently paid invoices to its agents and distributors in China and the Philippines and improperly recorded the payments as legitimate business expenses.  InVision's FCPA violations occurred, in part, because the company lacked adequate internal controls to detect and prevent such conduct. For example, InVision's sales department provided only informal training about the FCPA to its employees and foreign agents. Similarly, the company's sales department failed to monitor its employees and foreign agents to ensure that they did not violate the requirements of the FCPA. As InVision's head of sales and a member of the company's board of directors, Pillor aided and abetted InVision's failure to establish adequate internal controls.\"  (Source: US Securities and Exchange Commission Litigation Release No. 19803 / August 15, 2006, SEC v.

He was sentenced to 21 months' imprisonment and ordered to pay GBP 100,000 in compensation within 28 days to the Republic of Costa Rica or serve an additional 12 months imprisonment if he fails to do so. The corrupt payments were: (1) in 1999, a payment of $25,832.22 to Roxana Cordero Bogantes, the wife of Alvaro Alcuna, an agent of the Instituto Nacional de Seguros of the Republic of Costa Rica, and (2) in 2002, payment of $250,000 to Reska Financial Inc., a company associated with an agent of the Instituto Nacional de Seguros of the Republic of Costa Rica, namely Critobal Zawadski; both payments were as  inducment or reward for assisting in the appointment or retention of PWS International Limited as broker of the reinsurance contract known as \"U-500.\"  The Press Release also noted that between 1999 and 2002, Messent authorized 41 corrupt payments totalling $1,982,230.77 to Costa Rican officials, their wives and associated companies. This was a joint investigation by the SFO and the City of London Police.  Following elections in Costa Rica in 2002, officials in INS and ICE were replaced. Enquiries were made into the contract with PWS and the payments made unider it; the Foreign and Commonwealth Office referred the case to SFO in October 2005. (Source: UK Serious Fraud Office, \"Insurance Broker jailed for bribing Costa Rican officials,\" October 26, 2010.)  The US Government cited the case of Julian Messent in its Response to ICE's [Instituto Costariccense de Electricidad's] Petition for Victim Status and Restitution, noting that in Messent's case, he had admitted that he authorized corrupt payments of almost $2 million to Costa Rican officials at ICE and the state insurance company, Instituto Nacional de Seguros, and that under the UK sentencing order, Messent was not required to pay restitution to ICE or Instituto Nacional de Seguros. Rather, he was ordered to pay money to the government of Costa Rica, something which Alcatel-Lucent had done in the US settlement cases. (Source: US v.

Giffen, the Chairman of The Mercator Corporation (Mercator), a merchant bank with offices in New York and the Republic of Kazakhstan, was indicted in the Southern District of New York on charges that he made a series of illegal payments to senior Kazakh officials in connection with numerous oil deals in that country. According to court documents, Giffen allegedly made corrupt payments to senior Kazakh officials in connection with the following transactions in which Giffen represented the Republic of Kazakhstan: 1) Mobil Oil's 1996 purchase of a 25% share in the Tengiz oil field; (2) Mobil Oil's 1995 agreement to finance the processing and sale of gas condensate from the Karachaganak oil and gas field; (3) Amoco's 1997 purchase of a share in the Caspian Pipeline Consortium; (4) Texaco and other oil companies' purchase of a share in the Karachaganak oil and gas field in 1998; (5) Mobil and other oil companies' 1998 purchase of exploration rights in the Kazakh portion of the Caspian Sea, and; (6) Phillips Petroleum's 1998 purchase of Caspian Sea exploration rights. [  ] According to the original indictment, Giffen and Mercator were advisors to the Kazakh government on strategic planning, development of foreign investment and the negotiation of priority investment projects relating to the exploration, development, production, transportation, and processing of oil and gas. During this period, Giffen had held the title of counselor to the President of Kazakhstan. According to the charges, Mobil oil agreed to pay the success fees owed by Kazakhstan to Giffen and Mercator, and out of those fees, Giffen made unlawful payments of $22 million dollars to secret Swiss accounts beneficially owned by two high level Kazakh officials.  In addition, according to the Indictment, between 1995 and 2000, Giffen caused approximately $70 million paid by various oil companies into escrow accounts in Switzerland in connection with the purchase of oil and gas rights in Kazakhstan to be diverted into secret Swiss bank accounts under his control. Giffen then used this money to make additional unlawful payments of approximately $55 million to the two senior officials of the Kazakh Government.  Also on April 2, 2003, J. Bryan Williams a senior executive at Mobil Oil, was charged in connection with a kickback and tax evasion scheme involving a related oil deal in Kazakhstan. According to court documents, Williams was sent by Mobil's Chairman to finalize the negotiations with Kazakhstan regarding Mobil's purchase for approximately $1 billion of a 25% interest in the Tengiz oil field in 1996. After the Tengiz deal closed, Mobil paid $41 million to a New York merchant bank that represented the Republic of Kazakhstan in the transaction. The merchant bank's Chairman kicked back $2 million of that payment to Williams, by transferring money through a secret Swiss bank account.\"  (Source:  US Report to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, \"Steps taken to implement and enforce the OECD Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions,\" Information as of May 31, 2011, The Mercator Corporation Case Summary at 104-106.)

Giffen, the Chairman of The Mercator Corporation (Mercator), a merchant bank with offices in New York and the Republic of Kazakhstan, was indicted in the Southern District of New York on charges that he made a series of illegal payments to senior Kazakh officials in connection with numerous oil deals in that country. According to court documents, Giffen allegedly made corrupt payments to senior Kazakh officials in connection with the following transactions in which Giffen represented the Republic of Kazakhstan: 1) Mobil Oil's 1996 purchase of a 25% share in the Tengiz oil field; (2) Mobil Oil's 1995 agreement to finance the processing and sale of gas condensate from the Karachaganak oil and gas field; (3) Amoco's 1997 purchase of a share in the Caspian Pipeline Consortium; (4) Texaco and other oil companies' purchase of a share in the Karachaganak oil and gas field in 1998; (5) Mobil and other oil companies' 1998 purchase of exploration rights in the Kazakh portion of the Caspian Sea, and; (6) Phillips Petroleum's 1998 purchase of Caspian Sea exploration rights. [  ] According to the original indictment, Giffen and Mercator were advisors to the Kazakh government on strategic planning, development of foreign investment and the negotiation of priority investment projects relating to the exploration, development, production, transportation, and processing of oil and gas. During this period, Giffen had held the title of counselor to the President of Kazakhstan. According to the charges, Mobil oil agreed to pay the success fees owed by Kazakhstan to Giffen and Mercator, and out of those fees, Giffen made unlawful payments of $22 million dollars to secret Swiss accounts beneficially owned by two high level Kazakh officials.  In addition, according to the Indictment, between 1995 and 2000, Giffen caused approximately $70 million paid by various oil companies into escrow accounts in Switzerland in connection with the purchase of oil and gas rights in Kazakhstan to be diverted into secret Swiss bank accounts under his control. Giffen then used this money to make additional unlawful payments of approximately $55 million to the two senior officials of the Kazakh Government.\"  (Source:  US Report to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, \"Steps taken to implement and enforce the OECD Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions,\" Information as of May 31, 2011, The Mercator Corporation Case Summary at 104-106.)",

In all, according to court documents filed in the case against LatiNode, between March 2004 and June 2007, the company paid or caused to be paid approximately $1,099,889 in payments to third parties, knowing that some or all of those funds would be passed on as bribes to officials of Hondutel. In addition to the payments for the interconnection agreement, LatiNode admitted that these payments were also, in part, intended to secure reduced call termination rates for the company's traffic.  Each of these illicit payments originated from LatiNode's Miami bank account, and many of the payments were concealed by laundering the money through LatiNode subsidiaries in Guatemala and through accounts in Honduras controlled by Honduran government officials.\"  In Yemen, according to the same Report, \"LatiNode admitted that from approximately July 2005 through April 2006, the company made 17 payments totaling approximately $1,150,654 to a third-party consultant with the knowledge that some or all of the money would be passed on to Yemeni officials in exchange for favorable interconnection rates in Yemen. Each of these payments was also made from LatiNode?s Miami bank account. Company e-mails indicated that company executives believed that potential recipients of these payments included Yemeni government officials.\" (Source: US Report to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, \"Steps taken to implement and enforce the OECD Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions,\" Information as of May 31, 2011, Latin Node, Inc.

These jurisdictions fell within the business activities of Macmillan's Education Division in East and West Africa.

        "Summary": "According to the New York County District Attorney's Office Press Release on October 20, 2005, \"Manhattan District Attorney Robert M. Morgenthau announced today the guilty plea of a Reston, Virginia-based oil trading company for its involvement in a scheme to pay kickbacks to Iraq in connection with oil purchases made under the United Nations Oil-for-Food Program.  MIDWAY TRADING (MIDWAY) pleaded guilty in New York State Court to Grand Larceny in the First Degree in connection with the scheme. According to the charges, Midway and one of its trading partners, Bulf Oil, paid more than $440,000 in kickbacks to Iraqi officials in connection with oil purchases but falsely represented to the United Nations that no kickbacks were paid. Relying on those false representations, United Nations officials approved the contracts and authorized millions of dollars in payments for the benefit of Iraq from the Oil-for-Food Program. MIDWAY will pay a fine of $250,000, with $100,000 due by December 1, 2005. The plea by MIDWAY is part of a continuing investigation by the Manhattan District Attorney's Office into the Oil-for-Food Program. This investigation began as a result of this office's cooperation with the Independent Inquiry Committee into the United Nations Oil-for-Food Program, headed by Paul Volker.[  ]  Through its attorney, MIDWAY OIL admitted in court that in late 2000, the company purchased the right to lift oil from Iraq under the United Nations Oil-for-Food Program from Bulf Oil, a Romanian oil company. Under United Nations resolutions, all money paid for the purchase of Iraqi crude oil was deposited into a UN trust account at a branch of BNP Paribas, a French bank, in Manhattan. Payments from the trust account, including payments for so-called \"humanitarian goods\" to be sent to Iraq, had to be authorized by United Nations officials. No money for the purchase of crude oil from Iraq was to go directly to Iraq.  Under its initial $42 million agreement with Bulf, MIDWAY was to provide financing for the purchase cost of the Iraqi crude oil and to share any profits from MIDWAY's subsequent sale of that crude oil. An employee of Bulf Oil asked MIDWAY to pay him an additional 25 cents per barrel, an extra payment that MIDWAY did not make, at first.  MIDWAY sold the Iraqi crude oil lift to Texaco Corp., which, in turn, sold the crude oil lift to British Petroleum ('BP'). MIDWAY provided BP with a price guarantee. On March 28, 2001, a ship chartered by BP arrived at the Turkish Port of Ceyhan, but was not allowed to lift the oil. On April 1, 2001, MIDWAY wired $225,000 from an account at SunTrust Bank in Virginia to the Jordan National Bank's correspondent bank account at Chase Manhattan Bank in New York for the benefit of an account in name of the Bulf employee. The $225,000 was the approximate equivalent of the 25 cent per barrel kickback that the Bulf employee had asked for. On April 2nd and 3rd, the oil was loaded onto BP's ship. MIDWAY later learned that the money wired to the Jordan National Bank was for the benefit of Iraqi government officials and that the 'surcharge' had to be paid as a precondition for oil to be loaded. As a consequence of the price guarantee given to BP and the delay in lifting the oil, MIDWAY lost $ 1 million on this initial transaction.  In September, 2001, MIDWAY acquired the remainder of Bulf Oil's allocation of oil, at a purchase price of $22 million, under the Oil-for-Food Program. This time, prior to the lift of oil, MIDWAY wired $215,442.25 to Jordan National Bank's correspondent account at Chase Manhattan Bank in New York in the name of an agent of MIDWAY's. Midway knew that, as in the first transaction, the money wired to the Jordan National Bank account was, in fact, a kickback to be paid to Iraqi officials, in violation of United Nations Security Council Resolution 986. MIDWAY did not inform the UN about its payment to the Jordan National Bank. And, as MIDWAY knew, Bulf Oil's contract for the purchase of Iraqi oil falsely represented that all of the United Nations Security Council resolutions had been complied with. The second lift went smoothly and Midway profited approximately $375,000 from the sale of the crude oil.  The contract purchase price for the oil, $22 million, was paid into the United Nations trust account for the Oil-for-Food Program. Subsequently, relying on the false representations that no kickbacks had been paid, United Nations officials authorized the disbursement from the account of a like amount, less fees and administrative costs, for various purposes in accordance with program regulations. This included $13 million in payments for goods to be sent to Iraq.\" (Source:  New York County District Attorney's Office, News Release on Midway Trading Plea, October 20,2005.)",

The SEC Complaint had alleged that Montedison disguised hundreds of millions of dollars in payments that, among other things, were used to bribe politicians in Italy and other persons.  Virtually all of the former management at Montedison responsible for the fraud were convicted by Italian criminal authorities and were sued by the company. (Source: Litigation Release No. 16948, SEC v. Montedison, S.p.A., 1:96-cv-02631 (D.D.C.) and Complaint filed November 21, 1996.)   According to the Shearman & Sterling FCPA website case summary, \"This case was one of the first cases focusing on bribery brought by the SEC against a foreign issuer. The bribes formed the basis for the books and records violations and were allegedly paid by an Italian company to Italian politicians using offshore subsidiaries. It is, therefore, a unique FCPA case, as the bribes in question were paid by a foreign company to a foreign official in the same country, i.e., the officials were not \"foreign\" to the company.\" (Source: Case summary page, SEC v. Montedison, SpA, at http://fcpa.shearman.com/?s=matter&mode=form&id=68.)  According  to the SEC Complaint, (1) Exilar Loan was one of the fake loans that Montedison made through a wholly-owned subsidiary to Financing and Investments NV, a wholly-owend Curacao corporation, which in turn \"loaned\" the amount to Exilar International SA, a British Virgin Islands company.  The Complaint alleged that the Exilar Loan was designed to aggregate numerous bribes that had been paid over an extended period of time and disguise them as a single loan. Then in fiscal year ending in 1992, Montedison determined that the entire amount of the Exilar loan was uncollectible and should be written off.  (2) the ENIMONT Affair involved an effort by Montedison to gain control of ENIMONT, a joint venture by Montedison and the Italian state energy agency, ENI; Montedison management entered into an arrangment with a Rome real estate developer to pay artificially high prices thereby transferring  hundreds of millions of dollars with the Developer allegedly using this money to bribe politicians in Italy and other persons on Montedison's behalf.

Peterson, formerly a managing director of Morgan Stanley consented to a civil settlement to resolve FCPA and other fraud charges pending against him.  According to the press release, \"The SEC alleges that Garth R. Peterson, who was a managing director in Morgan Stanley's real estate investment and fund advisory business, had a personal friendship and secret business relationship with the former Chairman of Yongye Enterprise (Group) Co.  - a Chinese state-owned entity with influence over the success of Morgan Stanley's real estate business in Shanghai. Peterson secretly arranged to have at least $1.8 million paid to himself and the Chinese official that he disguised as finder's fees that Morgan Stanley's funds owed to third parties. Peterson also secretly arranged for him, the Chinese official, and an attorney to acquire a valuable Shanghai real estate interest from a Morgan Stanley fund. Peterson was acquiring an interest from the fund but negotiated both sides of the transaction. In exchange for offers and payments from Peterson, the Chinese official helped Peterson and Morgan Stanley obtain business while personally benefitting from some of these same investments. Peterson's deception, self-dealing, and misappropriation breached the fiduciary duties he owed to Morgan Stanley's funds as their representative.\"  (Source: US Securities and Exchange Commission Press Release 2012-78, \"SEC Charges Former Morgan Stanley Executive with FCPA Violations and Investment Adviser Fraud,\" April 25, 2012.)

        "Summary": "According to the press release issued by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, \"As a result of a six-year investigation conducted by the Calgary RCMP International Anti-Corruption Unit, a Calgary based, publicly-traded corporation, Niko Resources Ltd., was charged with one count of Section 3(1)(b) of the Corruption of Foreign Public Officials Act covering the period of February 1st, 2005 to June 30th, 2005.  Between the dates of the indictment, Niko provided the following improper benefits:  In May 2005, the company, through its subsidiary Niko Bangladesh, provided the use of a vehicle to AKM Mosharraf Hossain, the former Bangladeshi State Minister for Energy and Mineral Resources. The vehicle, which cost $190,984 CAN, was provided in order to influence the Minister in dealings with Niko Bangladesh. In June 2005, Niko paid travel and accommodation expenses for Minister AKM Mosharraf Hossain to travel from Bangladesh to Calgary to attend the GO EXPO oil and gas exposition. Niko also improperly paid approximately $5000 for non-business travel to New York and Chicago so the Minister could visit his family.  Today, Niko Resources Ltd. attended the Court of Queen's Bench and entered a guilty plea to the charge. Counsel for the Crown and Niko made a recommendation to the Court for a fine of $8,200,000 and the victim surcharge for a total of $9,499,000.00, which Justice Brooker of the Court of Queen's Bench imposed as the appropriate sentence. Niko Resources Ltd. has also been placed under a Probation Order which puts the company under the Court?s supervision for the next three years to ensure that audits are completed to examine Niko's compliance with the Corruption of Foreign Public Officials Act.  These types of investigations are complex and resource intensive, involving many separate jurisdictions. In addition, they cannot be completed without the cooperation of authorities in other countries.

According to court documents, between 2001 and 2003, a Jordan-based agent acting on behalf of Novo, an international manufacturer of insulin, medicines and other pharmaceutical supplies, made improper payments worth approximately $1.4 million to the former Iraqi government in order to obtain contracts with the Iraqi Ministry of Health to provide insulin and other medicines as part of the Oil-for-Food Program (OFFP).Novo engaged its long-time Jordan-based agent to submit bids on Novo's behalf to Kimadia, the Iraqi State Company for the Importation and Distribution of Drugs and Medical Appliances, a state-owned company which was part of the Iraqi Ministry of Health. Two branches of Novo Nordisk - RONE, based in Athens, Greece, and NEO, based in Amman, Jordan - handled the sales to the Iraq and supplied the agent with bid prices for each contract. In late 2000 or early 2001, a Kimadia import manager advised the agent that Kimadia required Novo Nordisk to pay a ten percent kickback in order to obtain a contract under the Program. The Kimadia import manager told the agent that Novo Nordisk should increase its prices by ten percent and pay that amount to Kimadia. By doing so, Novo would recover the secret kickback from the U.N. escrow account when the contract, with the inflated price, was subsequently approved for disbursement and paid by the U.N.  Beginning in 2001 and continuing through 2003, Novo paid these kickbacks, characterized as \"after-sales service fees\" (\"ASSFs\"), by inflating the price of contracts by 10 percent before submitting the contracts to the U.N. for approval. Novo also concealed from the U.N. the fact that the price contained a kickback to the former Iraqi government. In addition, on at least two occasions in 2001, Novo paid increased commissions to its agent to pay the kickbacks to Kimadia. The agent's commission was increased under the guise that the payment was used to cover the agent's increased distribution and marketing costs. All together, Novo paid over $1.4 million in kickbacks payments on eleven contracts through the agent, and agreed to pay approximately $1.3 million in ASSFs on two additional contracts.

Bourke Jr., and David Pinkerton were indicted in the Southern District of New York on charges of conspiracy to violate the FCPA and Travel Act, substantive FCPA violations, substantive Travel Act Violations, conspiracy to commit money laundering, substantive money laundering charges, and, in the case of Bourke and Pinkerton, making false statements. These charges stemmed from their role in a scheme to pay millions of dollars worth of bribes to Azeri government officials to ensure that the defendants' investment consortium would gain, in secret partnership with the Azeri officials, a controlling interest in the State Oil Company of the Azerbaijan Republic (SOCAR) and its substantial oil reserves.  According to evidence presented in the trial of Bourke, in August 1997, Kozeny allegedly agreed to transfer to corrupt Azeri officials two-thirds of the vouchers and options purchased by his investment consortium, Oily Rock, and to give them two-thirds of all of the profits arising from his investment consortium's participation in SOCAR's privatization. In addition, evidence presented at trial showed that in June 1998, Bourke knew that Kozeny arranged for Oily Rock to increase its authorized share capital from $150 million to $450 million so that the additional $300 million worth of Oily Rock shares could be transferred to one or more of the Azeri officials as a further bribe payment. Bourke also arranged for two of the corrupt officials to travel to New York City on different occasions in 1998 to receive medical treatment, for which Oily Rock paid. Thereafter, in interviews with the FBI in April and May of 2002, Bourke falsely stated that he was not aware that Kozeny had made the alleged payments to the Azeri Officials.  Three others have been charged in connection with their roles in this bribery scheme. Thomas Farrell, a former employee of Oily Rock, was charged in an information with one count of conspiracy to violate the FCPA and one count of violating the FCPA's anti-bribery provisions. On July 31, 2003, Clayton Lewis, a former principal of Omega Advisors and a co-investor in the scheme, was indicted on one count of conspiracy to violate the FCPA and one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering. On August 5, 2003, a grand jury in New York returned an indictment charging the third individual, Hans Bodmer, a Swiss lawyer who represented Kozeny and his investment consortium, with conspiring to violate the FCPA's anti-bribery provisions and conspiracy to commit money laundering. At the United States' request, Korea extradited Mr. Bodmer to the United States in 2004.  In June 2007, the Department entered into a nonprosecution agreement with Omega Advisors, regarding its role as a major investor in the consortium.\"  (Source: US Report to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, \"Steps taken to implement and enforce the OECD Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions,\" Information as of May 31, 2011, Oily Rock Case Summary at 102-103.)",

        "Summary": "According to the US Securities and Exchange Commission Litigation Release, on December 12, 2008, the Commission filed a settled civil complaint which alleged that \"Between March 12, 2001 and September 30, 2007, Siemens violated the FCPA by engaging in a widespread and systematic practice of paying bribes to foreign government officials to obtain business. Siemens created elaborate payment schemes to conceal the nature of its corrupt payments, and the company's inadequate internal controls allowed the conduct to flourish. The misconduct involved employees at all levels, including former senior management, and revealed a corporate culture long at odds with the FCPA. During this period, Siemens made thousands of payments to third parties in ways that obscured the purpose for, and the ultimate recipients of, the money. At least 4,283 of those payments, totaling approximately $1.4 billion, were used to bribe government officials in return for business to Siemens around the world. Among others, Siemens paid bribes on transactions to design and build metro transit lines in Venezuela; metro trains and signaling devices in China; power plants in Israel; high voltage transmission lines in China; mobile telephone networks in Bangladesh; telecommunications projects in Nigeria; national identity cards in Argentina; medical devices in Vietnam, China, and Russia; traffic control systems in Russia; refineries in Mexico; and mobile communications networks in Vietnam. Siemens also paid kickbacks to Iraqi ministries in connection with sales of power stations and equipment to Iraq under the United Nations Oil for Food Program. Siemens earned over $1.1 billion in profits on these transactions.   An additional approximately 1,185 separate payments to third parties totaling approximately $391 million were not properly controlled and were used, at least in part, for illicit purposes, including commercial bribery and embezzlement.\"  The Litigation Release also noted that Siemens consented to the SEC \"ordering it to pay $350 million in disgorgement of wrongful profits, which does not include profits factored into Munich's fine.\"  The Litigation Release also noted that assistance was provided to the SEC investigation by the Office of the Prosecutor General in Munich, Germany; the U.K. Financial Services Authority; and the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission.

        "Summary": "According to the US Securities and Exchange Litigation Release, \"From approximately 1996 until early 2007, senior executives at Siemens and its regional company in Argentina, Siemens S.A. (\"Siemens Argentina\"), paid bribes to senior Argentine government officials -- including two Presidents, and Cabinet Ministers in two Presidential administrations. The bribes were initially paid to secure a $1 billion government contract (the \"DNI Contract\") to produce national identity cards, or Documentos Nacionales de Identidad, for every Argentine citizen. Later, after a change in Argentine political administrations resulted in the DNI Contract being suspended and then canceled, Siemens paid additional bribes in a failed effort to bring the DNI Contract back into force. Still later, after the company instituted an arbitration proceeding to recover its costs and expected profits from the canceled DNI Contract, Siemens paid additional bribes to suppress evidence that the DNI Contract had originally been obtained through corruption. Over the course of the bribery scheme, over $100 million in bribes were paid, approximately $31.3 million of which were made after March 12, 2001, when Siemens became a U.S. issuer subject to U.S. securities laws. As a result of the bribe payments it made, Siemens received an arbitration award in 2007 against the government of Argentina of over $217 million plus interest for the DNI Contract. In August 2009, after settling bribery charges with the U.S. and Germany, Siemens waived the arbitration award.  During the relevant 2001 to 2007 time period, defendants Uriel Sharef, Ulrich Bock, Carlos Sergi, Stephan Signer, Herbert Steffen, Andres Truppel, and Bernd Regendantz each had a role in authorizing, negotiating, facilitating, or concealing bribe payments in connection with the DNI Contract. Siemens employed a group of consultants, designated the Project Group and led by defendant Sergi, to serve as payment intermediaries between the company and the Argentine government officials.\"  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, defendant Bernd Regendantz has consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $40,000, deemed satisfied by Regendantz' payment of a ?30,000 administrative fine ordered by the Public Prosecutor General in Munich, Germany.

Following this report, a case was opened by the Geneva Office of the Attorney-General. The investigation showed that between 2003 and 2007, X \u2013 a Swiss national \u2013 had paid intermediaries cash commissions totalling CHF 109 100 (approximately EUR 90 000) so that foreign diplomatic representations would choose to stay in his establishments. Examination of the accounting records of the companies operating the hotels showed in particular that CHF 48 000 had been paid in 2006-07 so that representatives of Office XY would stay in these establishments; that CHF 27 100 had been paid between 2003 and 2007 so that customers from consulate XY and permanent mission XY would stay there; and that CHF 34 000 had been paid so that customers connected with mission XY would stay there. The investigation determined that the payment of these commissions had enabled the hotels in question to generate turnover of CHF 1.5 million (or approximately EUR 1.2 million).  When questioned by the Geneva law enforcement authorities, the defendant acknowledged having paid commissions to attract customers, while contending that the customers brought in by the commissions had not, in his opinion, been members of official representations. The prosecutor in the case deemed, however, that a review of the accounting documents in evidence clearly showed that the customers were in fact official representatives, that a 2009 letter clearly indicated that the accused habitually paid commissions to foreign officials and lastly, that it made little difference whether the intermediaries receiving the commissions did not work formally for the various foreign missions insofar as a purpose of the commissions was to attract diplomatic clientele. The Geneva law enforcement authorities also rejected the defendant\u2018s contention that the payment of commissions to foreign public officials was a recurring practice in the hotel industry. After taking account of the defendant's lack of a criminal record and his personal and economic circumstances, and considering that the deeds of which he was accused were not serious enough to take the accused to trial, X was sentenced by Summary punishment order to a suspended fine of CHF 49 500 (approximately EUR 41 000), three years\u2018 probation and a fine of CHF 12 000 (approximately EUR 10 000).\" (Source:  Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development, \"Phase 3 Report on Implementing the OECD Anti-Bribery Convention in Switzerland,\" December 2011, at 54 and citing as its source Summary Punishment Order of the Attorney-General of the Republic and Canton of Geneva, 2 December 2010.).

On the same date, the SEC filed a settled civil action against Universal in the District of Columbia, charging the parent company with violations of the anti-bribery, books and records, and internal controls provisions of the FCPA. The criminal and civil charges against Universal and its subsidiary stem from schemes to bribe foreign officials in Thailand, Mozambique, and Malawi.  From 2000 to 2004, Universal Brazil and two of its competitors, Dimon Incorporated and Standard Commercial Corporation, sold Brazilian-grown tobacco to the Thailand Tobacco Monopoly (TTM). Each of these three companies retained sales agents in Thailand, and collaborated through those agents to apportion tobacco sales to the TTM among themselves, coordinate their sales prices, and pay kickbacks to officials of the Thailand Tobacco Monopoly in order to ensure that each company would share in the Thai tobacco market. These companies made annual sales to the TTM, and in order to secure these sales contracts, each company paid kickbacks to certain TTM representatives based on the number of kilograms of tobacco they sold to the TTM. To obtain these contracts, Universal Brazil paid approximately $697,000 in bribes to TTM officials during this period. In addition, Universal Brazil employees then falsely characterized the corrupt payments on the company's books and records as \"commissions\" paid to the company's sales agents.\"  (Source: US Report to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, \"Steps taken to implement and enforce the OECD Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions,\" Information as of May 31, 2011, Universal Corporation Case Summary at 44-45, accessed at http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/18/8/42103833.pdf.)

        "Summary": "According to the June 2011 United States Report to the OECD, On August 6, 2010, \"Universal Leaf Tabacos Ltda. (Universal Brazil), the Brazilian subsidiary of Universal Corporation (Universal), was charged in the Eastern District of Virginia with conspiring to violate the anti-bribery and books and records provisions of the FCPA, and with violating the anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA. On the same date, the SEC filed a settled civil action against Universal in the District of Columbia, charging the parent company with violations of the anti-bribery, books and records, and internal controls provisions of the FCPA. The criminal and civil charges against Universal and its subsidiary stem from schemes to bribe foreign officials in Thailand, Mozambique, and Malawi.  From 2000 to 2004, Universal Brazil and two of its competitors, Dimon Incorporated and Standard Commercial Corporation, sold Brazilian-grown tobacco to the Thailand Tobacco Monopoly (TTM). Each of these three companies retained sales agents in Thailand, and collaborated through those agents to apportion tobacco sales to the TTM among themselves, coordinate their sales prices, and pay kickbacks to officials of the Thailand Tobacco Monopoly in order to ensure that each company would share in the Thai tobacco market. These companies made annual sales to the TTM, and in order to secure these sales contracts, each company paid kickbacks to certain TTM representatives based on the number of kilograms of tobacco they sold to the TTM. To obtain these contracts, Universal Brazil paid approximately $697,000 in bribes to TTM officials during this period. In addition, Universal Brazil employees then falsely characterized the corrupt payments on the company's books and records as \"commissions\" paid to the company?s sales agents.\"  (Source: US Report to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, \"Steps taken to implement and enforce the OECD Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions,\" Information as of May 31, 2011, Universal Corporation Case Summary at 44-45, accessed at http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/18/8/42103833.pdf.)

        "Summary": "According to the New York County District Attorney's Office Press Release, on November 20, 2007, \"Manhattan District Attorney Robert M. Morgenthau announced today the guilty plea of a Switzerland-based oil trading company for its involvement in a scheme to pay kickbacks to Iraq in connection with oil purchases made under the United Nations Oil-for-Food Programme. VITOL, S.A. (VITOL) pleaded guilty today in New York State Court to Grand Larceny in the First Degree in connection with the scheme.  According to the plea, VITOL paid $13 million in kickbacks to Iraqi officials in connection with oil purchases but allowed false representations to be made to the United Nations that no kickbacks were paid.  Relying on those false representations, United Nations officials approved the contracts and authorized millions of dollars in payments for the benefit of Iraq from the Oil-for-Food Programme.  Instead of halting these transactions, United Nations officials were duped into allowing the Oil-for-Food Programme to continue unchanged. As a result of its guilty plea, VITOL will pay restitution of $13 million to the Iraqi people through the Development Fund for Iraq and a payment of $4.5 million in lieu of fines, forfeiture and to cover the cost of prosecution.  The plea by VITOL is part of a continuing investigation by the Manhattan District Attorney's Office into the Oil-for-Food Programme.  This investigation began as a result of this office's cooperation with the Independent Inquiry Committee into the United Nations Oil-for-Food Programme, headed by Paul Volcker. Mr. Morgenthau said, 'The Oil for Food Programme was established by the United Nations with the noble goal of providing for the humanitarian needs of the Iraqi people.  One outcome of this investigation, and last week's joint investigation involving Chevron, is to insure that illegal funds that were paid to Saddam Hussein's government are redirected to benefit the Iraqi people.'  Through its representative, duly appointed by Vitol's Board of Directors, VITOL admitted in court today that while the United Nations Oil-for-Food Programme was in effect, VITOL purchased Iraqi crude oil first as a direct purchaser and later from third-parties.  In June 2001, after an OPEC meeting, an agent of VITOL was told by Iraqi officials that surcharges had to be paid in order for Iraqi crude oil to be lifted.  Over the next year, VITOL paid or caused surcharges to be paid on certain oil purchases in two ways.   In direct purchases, VITOL had an associated entity called Vitol Bahrain send the surcharge monies to accounts controlled by the Iraqi regime.  In indirect purchases, VITOL financed the purchase of oil through third-parties who then paid the surcharge to the Iraqi regime.  VITOL did not inform the UN about the surcharge payments.  During the period from June 2001 through September 2002, approximately $13,000,000 in surcharge monies were paid directly to the Iraqi regime in connection with crude oil purchased directly or indirectly by VITOL.  The investigation into the United Nations? Oil-for-Food Programme has resulted into two other actions against oil companies.  Last week, there was a settlement with the  Chevron Oil Company in which Chevron paid $27 million, of which $20 million was paid as restitution for the benefit of the Iraqi people.  In October 2005, Midway Trading pleaded guilty for paying kickbacks to Iraq for oil purchases.\"  Mr. Morgenthau thanked the Independent Inquiry Committee into the United Nations Oil-for-Food Programme and Paul Volcker who heads the Committee.

These charges stemmed from a bribery scheme involving senior officials of WII, which involved the corrupt payment of more than $6.3 million to Nigerian officials in connection with a gas pipeline construction project and $300,000 to Ecuadorian officials in connection with a gas pipeline rehabilitation project.From late 2003 through March 2005, WII employees agreed to make corrupt payments totaling more than $6.3 million to officials of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), the state-owned oil company in Nigeria; NNPC's subsidiary, the National Petroleum Investment Management Services (NAPIMS); a senior official in the executive branch of the Nigerian federal government; officials of a multinational oil company; and a Nigerian political party. These bribes were paid to Nigerian government officials to assist in obtaining and retaining a $387 million contract for work on a major engineering, procurement and construction gas pipeline project known as the Eastern Gas Gathering System (EGGS). In addition, in 2004, various WII employees paid at least $300,000 to officials of the Ecuadorian state-owned oil company in order to obtain a gas pipeline rehabilitation contract. [ ] Jason Edward Steph, WII's General Manager-Onshore in Nigeria, was indicted July 19, 2007.

        "Summary": "According to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission Litigation Release, on May 14, 2008, the Commission \"filed a settled civil action against Willbros Group, Inc. and several former employees alleging that they violated, among other things, the anti-bribery provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws. The complaint also names Jason Steph, a former supervisory employee in Nigeria, Gerald Jansen, a former administrative supervisor in Nigeria, Lloyd Biggers, a former employee in Nigeria and Carlos Galvez, a former accounting employee in Bolivia. According to the complaint, the company also violated the reporting, books and records and internal controls provisions of the Securities Exchange Act. Willbros Group, Steph, Jansen, Biggers and Galvez have agreed to settle the charges against them, without admitting or denying the Commission's allegations. The Commission alleges in its complaint that Willbros Group, through the actions of others acting on its behalf, engaged in multiple schemes to bribe foreign officials. First, the complaint alleges that, beginning by at least 2003, Willbros Group, through the conduct of a former executive officer, Steph and others, engaged in a scheme to pay over $6 million in bribes to Nigerian government officials and to employees of an operator of a joint venture majority-owned by the Nigerian government in order to obtain a significant contract. A similar scheme was used to help obtain a second significant contract. Together, these contracts resulted in net profits of approximately $8,900,000. In 2005, according to the complaint, Steph assisted in the payment of $850,000 to satisfy a portion of these earlier commitments. The complaint further alleges that Willbros Group, through acts by a former executive officer, Steph, Jansen, Biggers and others, employed a long-running scheme using fabricated invoices to procure cash from the company's administrative headquarters in Houston to, among other things, bribe Nigerian tax and court officials. This fraudulent cash abuse was also used to fund in part the bribes paid in 2005.  Second, Willbros Group, through the conduct of the same former executive officer and others schemed to pay a $300,000 bribe to officials of an oil and gas company owned by the Ecuador government in order to obtain a $3 million contract. Finally, Willbros Group, through the actions of the same former executive officer, an outside consultant and Galvez implemented a fraudulent tax avoidance scheme in Bolivia. This fraudulent scheme resulted in material misstatements in Willbros Group's financial statements.\"  (Source:  US Securities and Exchange Commission Litigation Release No. 20571 / May 14, 2008, SEC v.

These charges stemmed from a bribery scheme involving senior officials of WII, which involved the corrupt payment of more than $6.3 million to Nigerian officials in connection with a gas pipeline construction project and $300,000 to Ecuadorian officials in connection with a gas pipeline rehabilitation project.From late 2003 through March 2005, WII employees agreed to make corrupt payments totaling more than $6.3 million to officials of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), the state-owned oil company in Nigeria; NNPC's subsidiary, the National Petroleum Investment Management Services (NAPIMS); a senior official in the executive branch of the Nigerian federal government; officials of a multinational oil company; and a Nigerian political party. These bribes were paid to Nigerian government officials to assist in obtaining and retaining a $387 million contract for work on a major engineering, procurement and construction gas pipeline project known as the Eastern Gas Gathering System (EGGS).

(York FZE was a subsidiary of York Air Conditioning and Refrigeration Inc., a Delaware formed subsidiary of York International, whose branch office in Dubai served as headquarters of York's Middle East operations.)  According to the Statement of Facts, approximately $7 milion in Iraqi contracts were obtained as a result; all contracts through the UN Oil-for-Food program. Additionally, from 1999 to 2005, employees of YACR and York FZE paid kickbacks and bribes to employees of government customers and contractors of government customers in order to obtain and retain approximately $42 million in contracts on government projects in UAE, Egypt, Babrain, Turkey, and India.  In the UAE, during 2003-20004, YACR and York FZE secured contractss worth $3.7 million related to a luxury hotel and convention complex in Abu Dhabi; the subsidiaries made 13 payments totalling $550,000 to an intermediary  in circumstances that make it likely that the intermediary made corrupt payments to members of the hotel and convention complex's executive committee, which was established by UAE government decree and which represented the UAE's Ministry of Finance and Industry in managing the construction of the complex.

An Alcatel subsidiary provided at least $14.5 million to consulting firms through sham consulting agreements for use in the bribery scheme in Costa Rica.  Various high-level government officials in Costa Rica received at least $7 million of the $14.5 million to ensure Alcatel obtained or retained three contracts to provide telephone services in Costa Rica.  The SEC alleges that the same Alcatel subsidiary bribed officials in the government of Honduras to obtain or retain five telecommunications contracts.  Another Alcatel subsidiary made bribery payments to Malaysian government officials in order to procure a telecommunications contract.  An Alcatel subsidiary also made illegal payments to various officials in the government of Taiwan to win a contract to supply railway axle counters to the Taiwan Railway Administration. According to the SEC's complaint, all of the bribery payments were undocumented or improperly recorded as consulting fees in the books of Alcatel's subsidiaries and then consolidated into Alcatel's financial statements.

        "Summary": "According to the UK Serious Fraud Office Press Release, \"Today at Southwark Crown Court BAE Systems Plc was fined \u00a3500,000 after admitting it had failed to keep adequate accounting records in relation to a defence contract for the supply of an air traffic control system to the Government of Tanzania.  This outcome follows a settlement by BAE as part of a global agreement it reached earlier this year with the Serious Fraud Office and the US Department of Justice concerning contracts in a number of countries. The settlement with the SFO relates to the Tanzania contract whereby BAE agreed to pay an ex-gratia payment for the benefit of the people of Tanzania of \u00a340 million less any fine imposed by the Crown Court.  Additionally, BAE was ordered to pay \u00a3225,000 costs to the SFO.  [  ] A contract for the supply of a radar defence system for Dar-es-Salaam International Airport was agreed in 1999 between British Aerospace Defence Systems Ltd and the government of Tanzania. (This followed negotiations that had been conducted since 1992 initially by Siemens Plessey Systems which was acquired by BAE in 1998). The value of the contract was US $39.97 million. BAE's practice was to engage advisers to help with its marketing. These advisers were either classified by BAE as 'overt' (i.e. that is they operated openly as BAE's in-country representatives), or 'covert'. The latter operated in circumstances where there was a need for confidentiality. In order to maximise confidentiality with regard to its use of covert advisers and the making of payments to them, BAE set up Red Diamond Trading Company, incorporated in the British Virgin Islands. In Tanzania a local businessman, Shailesh Vithlani, was recruited at an early stage (initially by Siemens) to advise BAE on its negotiations with the government on the radar contract. Shortly before the contract was signed two new adviser arrangements with Vithlani were concluded. One was made between Red Diamond and a Vithlani-controlled Panama-incorporated company, Envers Trading Corporation. This was a 'covert' arrangement where the fee for Vithlani's services was to be not more than 30.025% of the radar contract price. The other arrangement was 'overt' and was for services direct to BAE by a Vithlani-controlled business, Merlin International, registered in the B.V.I. It did not involve Red Diamond and the fee was 1% of the radar contract value.  Between January 2000 and December 2005 around $12.4 million was paid to Vithlani's two companies. BAE has accepted that there was a high probability that part of this sum would be used to favour it in the contract negotiations.  The payments were not subject to proper and adequate scrutiny or review.  Furthermore, it was not possible for any person auditing the accounts to investigate and determine whether the payments were properly accounted for or were lawful. In sentencing BAE, the Judge said that he took the view that BAE were concealing from the auditors and ultimately the public the fact that they were making payments to Vithlani; 97% of them via two offshore companies, with the intention that he should have free rein to make such payments to such people as he thought fit in order to secure the radar contract for BAE but that BAE did not want to know the details.  The Judge took into account in sentencing BAE that the group had committed itself to a process of change following the Report of Lord Woolf and that BAE would be making a payment for the benefit of the people of Tanzania of \u00a340 million less the fine. The Judge said that the people of Tanzania were the real victims. The Judge decided in these circumstances to impose a fine of \u00a3500,000.\" (Source:  UK Serious Fraud Office Press Release, \"BAE fined in Tanzania defence contract case,\" December 21, 2010, accessed at http://www.sfo.gov.uk/press-room/latest-press-releases/press-releases-2010/bae-fined-in-tanzania-defence-contract-case.aspx.)",

The High Court made the Order under Part 5 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002. The SFO recognised that MWKL took no part in the criminal activity which generated the funds. The funds due to MWKL are share dividends payable from profits and revenues generated by contracts obtained by bribery and corruption undertaken by MWKL's parent company and others.  The agreement will lead to the payment of \u00a37,028,077 within fourteen days in full and final settlement of the case.  This sum represents the share dividends due and the interest which has accrued on these sums.The contracts were awarded to a company partly owned by MWKL on behalf of its US parent company.  MWKL reported concerns to the SFO under the \"self referral\" scheme and fully co-operated with the subsequent investigation. The SFO, working in partnership with the US Department of Justice, reviewed the conduct of MWKL and decided that the most appropriate approach was to remove the funds which will become due to the company through the unlawful conduct.

Joel Esquenazi, the former president of the telecommunications company; Carlos Rodriguez, the former executive vice-president of the telecommunications company; Marguerite Grandison, the former president of Telecom Consulting Services Corp.; Robert Antoine, a former director of international relations at the Republic of Haiti's state-owned national telecommunications company, Telecommunications D'Haiti (Haiti Teleco); and Jean Rene Duperval, another former director of international relations at Haiti Teleco, were charged in connection with a scheme whereby the telecommunications company paid more than $800,000 to shell companies, including Grandison's Telecom Consulting Services Corp., to be used for bribes to foreign officials of Haiti Teleco. The purpose of these bribes was to obtain various business advantages from the Haitian officials for the telecommunications company, including issuing preferred telecommunications rates, reducing the number of minutes for which payment was owed, and giving a variety of credits toward owed sums, as well as to defraud the Republic of Haiti of revenue.Previously, on April 22, 2009, Juan Diaz, the president of J.D. Locator Services Inc., a Florida-based intermediary, and Antonio Perez, the former controller of the Florida-based telecommunications company, were charged in connection with their roles in the alleged foreign bribery scheme. According to court documents, from 1998 to 2003, Diaz and Perez conspired to make \"side payments\" totaling $1 million to the Haitian government officials through a shell company belonging to Diaz, all on behalf of the Florida-based telecommunications company.On February 1, 2010, Jean Fourcand, the president of Fourcand Enterprises, Inc., another intermediary company, was charged in a one-count criminal information with engaging in monetary transactions involving property derived from the scheme to bribe the former Haitian government officials. Specifically, between November 2001 and August 2002, Fourcand received funds originating from this and other U.S. telecommunications companies for the benefit of Robert Antoine.

In May 2007 he signed a contract worth \u00a3210,000 with British company CBRN Ltd, for CBRN to supply services to the government for a forthcoming Commonwealth visit by heads of state. Following the agreement, Tumukunde approached CBRN Managing Director, Niels Tobiasen, claiming that he would need to make additional payments via Tumukunde to meet a local tax of 10%.  Tobiasen agreed and a total of six payments worth over \u00a383,000 were made to both Tumukunde and another Ugandan, Rusoke Tagaswire between 1 June 2007 and 1 February 2008. Tumukunde and Tagaswire recorded the money as being paid to them as agents of the Ugandan government working on the contract, when in fact they were inducements going directly into two bank accounts Tumukunde had opened in his own name in the UK.  Tumukunde was charged with four counts of money laundering and sentenced to 12 months in prison on 22nd September 2008.

The company is to pay  \u00a3.6M. This is the first prosecution brought in the UK against a  company for these offences. The company, which is a supplier of steel bridging and is based in Twyford, Berkshire, had already indicated at a magistrates' court hearing on 10 July 2009 that it would plead guilty to these offences. / Corruption - The prosecution for corruption arises from the company's voluntary disclosure to the SFO of evidence to indicate that the company had sought to influence decision-makers in public contracts in Jamaica and Ghana between 1993 and 2001. The decision to voluntarily disclose the corruption offences to the SFO was taken by the management of Mabey & Johnson's holding company in February 2008 whereupon an investigation was opened. / Breach of UN sanctions - The prosecution for breach of UN sanctions during 2001/02, as they applied to contracts in the Iraq \"Oil-for-food\" programme, arises from an investigation commenced in January 2007.  The details of the sentence today are:  Fines: Ghana  \u00a3750,000; Jamaica  \u00a3750,000; Iraq  \u00a32 million; Confiscation order  \u00a31.1million; Reparations: Ghana  \u00a3658,000; Jamaica  \u00a3139,000; Iraq  \u00a3618,000.

According to a UK Parliamentary Report, \"In respect of Jamaica and Ghana the company undertook to offer the sums described above to its customers in Jamaica and Ghana. The undertaking by the company included a provision dealing with the possibility that the company would be unable to reach an agreement with its customers within six years or if it became evident at a prior date that no such agreement was likely to be reached. In those circumstances the payment would be made to the SFO or any successor body. The SFO's understanding is that the reparation payment has been made to the customer in Jamaica. The company has been unsuccessful, however, in its attempts to reach agreement with its Ghanaian customer. It is understood that the issue here concerns the reluctance of the Ghanaian authorities to accept that any corruption was involved. A different scheme is in operation relating to Iraq. A Development Fund for Iraq was set up internationally and payments in Oil for Food cases are made to that fund. There is therefore an international mechanism for compensation.\" (Source: UK House of Commons, International Development Financial Crime and Development, Eleventh Report of Session 2010?12, Volume I (November 30, 2011), Appendix B, \"Notes on Other Cases by the Serious Fraud Office.\") ",

        "Summary": "According to a UK Serious Fraud Office Press Release, on April 8, 2011, the SFO obtained a Civil Recovery Order for GBP 4.829 million and prosecution costs against DePuy International Limited (a UK subsidiary of the US parent company Johnson & Johnson), \"in recognition of unlawful conduct relating to the sale of orthopaedic products in Greece between 1998 and 2006.\"  The SFO launched its investigation following a referral from the US Department of Justice in October 2007 and worked closely with the US DOJ and the Securities and Exchange Commission.  \"The unlawful conduct consisted of payments made by DePuy International Limited to intermediaries for the purpose of making corrupt payments to Greek medical professionals working in the Greek public health system. Payments to the intermediaries amounted to twenty percent of the price, at which the orthopaedic product was ultimately sold. These payments covered the commission for the intermediary and were available to be used to pay inducements or rewards for the use of orthopaedic products sold by DePuy International Limited. [  ] The corporate benefit sought by DePuy International Limited, as a result of the payments to intermediaries, was retention and enhancement of market position. The Greek government paid DePuy International Limited's intermediaries approximately \u00a333.5 million for orthopaedic products between 1998 and 2007.  [  ] On the facts of this case, criminal sanction of the Greek conduct has been achieved by the conclusion of a Deferred Prosecution Agreement with DePuy International Limited's parent company and the DOJ.  The Director of the Serious Fraud Office has concluded that a prosecution was therefore prevented in this jurisdiction by the principles of double jeopardy. The underlying purpose of the rule against double jeopardy is to stop a defendant from being prosecuted twice for the same offence in different jurisdictions. The DOJ Deferred Prosecution Agreement has the legal character of a formally concluded prosecution and punishes the same conduct in Greece that had formed the basis of the Serious Fraud Office investigation.  Combined criminal and civil sanctions have therefore been imposed in the United States in respect of Depuy International Limited's parent and assets have been frozen in the ongoing Greek investigation, all relating to the same conduct in Greece. Consequently the Serious Fraud office is satisfied that the most appropriate sanction is a Civil Recovery Order, under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002.  As has been described approximately \u00a333.5 million represents the sales, tainted by the unlawful conduct, made to public hospitals by DePuy International Limited's Greek intermediaries. Approximately \u00a314.8 million of this passed from the Greek intermediary to DePuy International Limited in respect of orthopaedic products for use in the public health care system. Consequently \u00a314.8 million can be said to represent unlawfully obtained property.  In the context of a global resolution, the Serious Fraud Office has taken particular note of the fact of disgorgement and recovery in more than one jurisdiction for the same underlying unlawful conduct. The Serious Fraud Office has also taken into account asset tracing difficulties.\" (Source:  UK Serious Fraud Office Press Release, \"DePuy International Limited ordered to pay 4.829 million pounds in Civil Recovery Order,\" April 8, 2011.)",

These employees also threatened to undermine or undo HWC\u2018s contracts with PdVSA if the company refused to pay the requested kickbacks.

[ ]  Oxford University Press East Africa (OUPEA) is based in Kenya but covers a geographical region which includes Kenya, Burundi, Malawi, Rwanda, Sudan and Uganda.  Oxford University Press Tanzania (OUPT) is based in mainland Tanzania but also has responsibility for the semi-autonomous Zanzibar archipelago.  Both OUPT and OUPEA are wholly owned subsidiaries of OPL and part of the International Division of OUP. [ ]  In 2011, OUP became aware of the possibility of irregular tendering practices involving its education business in East Africa.  OUP acted immediately to investigate the matter, instructing independent lawyers and forensic accountants to undertake a detailed investigation. As a result of the investigation, in November 2011 OUP voluntarily reported certain concerns in relation to contracts arising from a number of tenders which its Kenyan and Tanzanian subsidiaries, OUPEA and OUPT, entered into between the years 2007 and 2010.  [ ] The product of [the company's self investigation] led the SFO and the World Bank to believe that OUPEA and OUPT had offered and made payments, directly and through agents, intended to induce the recipients to award competitive tenders and/or publishing contracts for schoolbooks to OUPEA and OUPT.  [ ] The value of the Order made by the High Court is \u00a31,895,435 [ ]. OPL will also pay the SFO costs of pursuing the order which amount to \u00a312,500. [ ] In addition to the property recovered under the civil recovery order, OUP unilaterally offered to contribute \u00a31,000,000 to not-for-profit organisations for teacher training and other educational purposes in sub-Saharan Africa.  This was a reflection of the seriousness with which OUP views the course of events that were subject to the investigation and a wish to acknowledge that the conduct of OUPEA and OUPT fell short of that expected within its wider organisation.  The contribution would benefit the people within the affected region and be consistent with the overall mission of OUP.  The offer also confirmed that the funds would not be used so as to provide OUP with a commercial advantage.  Although the benefits to the people of the affected region are acknowledged by the SFO, the SFO decided that the offer should not be included in the terms of the court order as the SFO considers it is not its function to become involved in voluntary payments of this kind.   However, the SFO welcomes OUP's commitment to make this contribution and to work with a range of not-for-profit organisations in sub-Saharan Africa to achieve the above objectives.\"  (Source: UK Serious Fraud Office press release, \"Oxford Publishing Ltd to pay almost ?.9 million as settlement after admitting unlawful conduct in its East African operations,\" July 3, 2012.)

The confiscation order, made against Glasgow-based Weir Group Plc, is the biggest ever made by a Scottish court.  At the High Court in Edinburgh today, the company was also fined \u00a33 million after pleading guilty to paying more than \u00a33m in \u2018kickbacks\u2019, in contravention of UN sanctions against Iraq, through a Swiss bank account.  The Weir Group also admitted facilitating the payment of kickbacks by paying a fee of more than \u00a31.4 m to their agent, an Iraqi national, to the same Swiss bank account. The agent made the payments to the Iraqi government on behalf of Weir.  The kickbacks were paid to the Iraqi Government from funds in the UN\u2019s Oil for Food Programme, which should have been used for humanitarian purposes. An Independent Inquiry Committee set up by the UN has estimated that, in total, about US $1.5 billion that could have been used to ease the suffering of the Iraqi people was paid as kickbacks to Saddam Hussein's government. The Lord Advocate, the Right Honourable Elish Angiolini QC, said: 'This case represents the biggest single confiscation order made so far in Scotland using the Proceeds of Crime legislation. It is the result of a highly successful collaboration between National Casework Division of the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service, Strathclyde Police and the Serious Fraud Office. In this year alone we have recovered over \u00a324 million, a record amount under the Proceeds of Crime legislation.'\"  The news release added that in notes to editors: \"Weir Group companies secured 16 contracts for which they were paid \u00a334,340,204 by paying kickbacks of \u00a33,104,527. The confiscation order has been granted for \u00a313,945,962.\" This includes Weir\u2019s gross profit of \u00a39, 414,283 from the contracts - plus the kickback of \u00a33,104,527 and the fee of \u00a31,427,152 paid to Weir\u2019s agent in Iraq.(Source:  The Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service news release, \"CROWN SECURES RECORD \u00a313.9M AS WEIR GROUP CONVICTED OF PAYING KICKBACKS FOR IRAQ CONTRACTS,\" December 15, 2010.)

These failings created an unacceptable risk that payments made by Willis Limited to overseas third parties could be used for corrupt purposes. This is the biggest fine imposed by the FSA in relation to financial crime systems and controls to date.  Between January 2005 and December 2009, Willis Limited made payments to overseas third parties who assisted it in winning and retaining business from overseas clients, particularly in high risk jurisdictions. These payments totalled \u00a327 million. The FSA investigation found that, up until August 2008, Willis Limited failed to: \u2022ensure that it established and recorded an adequate commercial rationale to support its payments to overseas third parties; \u2022ensure that adequate due diligence was carried out on overseas third parties to evaluate the risk involved in doing business with them; and \u2022adequately review its relationships on a regular basis to confirm whether it was still necessary and appropriate for Willis Limited to continue with the relationship.\"  The press release also noted that Willis Ltd. agreed to settle at an early stage and was therefore given a 30% (stage 1) discount, without which the fine would have been GBP 9.85 million [US$15,886,900].

This Overseas Third Party had a complex operational structure. The company was registered as a foreign company in Liberia, had a bank account in Switzerland and was controlled by a Trust Company in the Isle of Man.\" (para 4.19); Willis Limited is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Willis group of companies, whose ultimate parent is the Willis Group Holdings Plc, incorporated in Dublin, Ireland.

(Alba). Mr Hall served as CEO of Alba, from September 2001 to June 2005.\r\n \r\n Judge Loraine Smith, who presided over the hearing, heard how Mr Hall received \u00a32.9 million in corrupt\r\n payments between 2002 and 2005, including 10,000 Bahraini dinars in cash from Sheikh Isa bin Ali Al\r\n Khalifa, a member of the Bahraini royal family and at the time Bahrain\u2019s minister of finance and Alba\u2019s\r\n chairman.

Between 2001 and 2008, Utama managers made improper payments to employees of state-owned entities in Indonesia in order to obtain and retain business. Allianz learned of the improper payments from two complaints made several years apart. The first complaint was submitted in 2005 alleging significant misconduct, including unsupported payments to agents. A subsequent audit of Utama\u2019s accounting records uncovered that managers at Utama were using \u201cspecial purpose accounts\u201d to make illicit payments, many to government officials, in order to secure business in Indonesia. Despite the audit, the conduct continued. The second complaint was lodged in 2009 to Allianz\u2019s external auditors and alleged that Allianz created illicit off-the-books accounts. In response, Allianz began an internal investigation. The Commission staff opened an investigation in April 2010 after receiving an anonymous complaint of possible FCPA violations. The investigation determined that from at least 2001 through December 2008, the Utama managers, with the assistance of others in the Indonesian office, made payments to employees of state-owned entities in Indonesia to procure or retain insurance contracts related to large government projects in Indonesia. As a result of improper payments of approximately $650,626 to agents and employees of state-owned entities and others, Allianz realized $5,315,649 in profits.\" The SEC\u2019s order found that Allianz violated the books and records and internal controls provisions of the FCPA, specifically Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Without admitting or denying the findings, Allianz agreed to cease and desist from further violations and pay disgorgement of $5,315,649, prejudgment interest of $1,765,125, and a penalty of $5,315,649 for a total of $12,396,423.

Internal Alstom documents refer to some of the consultants in code, including \u201cMr. Geneva,\u201d \u201cMr. Paris,\u201d \u201cLondon,\u201d \u201cQuiet Man\u201d and \u201cOld Friend.\u201d\r\n \r\n The sentence, which is the largest criminal fine ever imposed in an FCPA case, reflects a number of factors, including: Alstom\u2019s failure to voluntarily disclose the misconduct, even though it was aware of related misconduct at a U.S. subsidiary that previously resolved corruption charges with the department in connection with a power project in Italy\u037e Alstom\u2019s refusal to fully cooperate with the department\u2019s investigation for several years\u037e the breadth of the companies\u2019 misconduct, which spanned many years, occurred in countries around the globe and in several business lines, and involved sophisticated schemes to bribe high-level government officials\u037e Alstom\u2019s lack of an effective compliance and ethics program at the time of the conduct\u037e and Alstom\u2019s prior criminal misconduct, including conduct that led to resolutions with various other governments and the World Bank.\" (Source: US Department of Justice Press Release, \"Alstom Sentenced to Pay $772 Million Criminal Fine to Resolve Foreign Bribery Charges,\" November 1, 2015.)",

        "Summary": "According to the US Department of Justice, Marubeni Corporation, a Japanese trading company involved in the handling of products and provision of services in a broad range of sectors around the world, including power generation pleaded guilty in 2014 to \"one count of conspiracy to violate the anti-bribery provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and seven counts of violating the FCPA. The company signed a plea agreement in which it admitted its criminal conduct, agreed to maintain and implement an enhanced global anti-corruption compliance program and to cooperate with the department\u2019s ongoing investigation, and agreed to pay an $88 million fine, which the court accepted in imposing the sentence. The plea agreement cites Marubeni\u2019s refusal to cooperate with the department\u2019s investigation when given the opportunity to do so, its lack of an effective compliance and ethics program at the time of the offense, and its failure to timely remediate as several of the factors considered by the department in determining the resolution.\r\n \r\n According to the court filings, Marubeni and its employees, together with others, paid bribes to officials in Indonesia \u2013 including a high-ranking member of the Indonesian Parliament and high-ranking members of Perusahaan Listrik Negara (PLN), the state-owned and state-controlled electricity company in Indonesia \u2013 in exchange for assistance in securing a $118 million contract, known as the Tarahan project, for the company and its consortium partner to provide power-related services for the citizens of Indonesia. To conceal the bribes, Marubeni and its consortium partner retained two consultants purportedly to provide legitimate consulting services on behalf of the power company and its subsidiaries in connection with the Tarahan project. The primary purpose for hiring the consultants, however, was to use the consultants to pay bribes to Indonesian officials.\r\n \r\n Also according to court filings, the first consultant retained by Marubeni and its co-conspirators received hundreds of thousands of dollars in his U.S. bank account to be used to bribe the member of Parliament. The consultant then allegedly transferred the bribe money to a bank account in Indonesia for the benefit of the official. E-mails between the co-conspirators discuss in detail the use of the first consultant to funnel bribes to the member of Parliament and the influence that the member of Parliament could exert over the Tarahan project.\r\n \r\n As admitted in court documents, in the fall of 2003, Marubeni and its co-conspirators determined that the first consultant was not effectively bribing key officials at PLN. As a result, Marubeni and its consortium partner decided to reduce the first consultant\u2019s commission from three percent of the total contract value to one percent, and pay the remaining two percent to a second consultant who could more effectively bribe officials at PLN. In an e-mail between two employees of Marubeni\u2019s consortium partner, they discussed a meeting between Marubeni, an executive from the consortium partner, and the first consultant, stating that the consultant \u201ccommitted to convince [the member of Parliament] that \u2018one\u2019 [percent] is enough.\u201d Marubeni and its co-conspirators were successful in securing the Tarahan project and subsequently made payments to the consultants for the purpose of bribing the Indonesian officials.\r\n \r\n Frederic Pierucci, a current executive at Marubeni\u2019s consortium partner, pleaded guilty on July 29, 2013, to one count of conspiring to violate the FCPA and one count of violating the FCPA. David Rothschild, a former vice president of regional sales at the consortium partner, pleaded guilty on Nov. 2, 2012 to one count of conspiracy to violate the FCPA. Lawrence Hoskins, a former senior vice president for the Asia region for the consortium partner, and William Pomponi, a former vice president of regional sales at the consortium partner, were charged in a second superseding indictment on July 30, 2013.\" (Source: US DOJ Press Release, \"Marubeni Corporation Sentenced for Foreign Bribery Violations,\" May 15, 2014.)",

        "Summary": "According to the US Securities and Exchange Commission Press Release, the agency \"today charged global food processor Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (ADM) for failing to prevent illicit payments made by foreign subsidiaries to Ukrainian government officials in violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA).\r\n \r\n An SEC investigation found that ADM\u2019s subsidiaries in Germany and Ukraine paid $21 million in bribes through intermediaries to secure the release of value-added tax (VAT) refunds. The payments were then concealed by improperly recording the transactions in accounting records as insurance premiums and other purported business expenses. ADM had insufficient anti-bribery compliance controls and made approximately $33 million in illegal profits as a result of the bribery by its subsidiaries. [ ] \r\n \r\n According to the SEC\u2019s complaint filed in U.S. District Court for the Central District of Illinois, the bribery occurred from 2002 to 2008. Ukraine imposed a 20 percent VAT on goods purchased in its country. If the goods were exported, the exporter could apply for a refund of the VAT already paid to the government on those goods. However, at times the Ukrainian government delayed paying VAT refunds it owed or did not make any refund payments at all. On these occasions, the outstanding amount of VAT refunds owed to ADM\u2019s Ukraine affiliate reached as high as $46 million.\r\n \r\n The SEC alleges that in order to obtain the VAT refunds that the Ukraine government was withholding, ADM\u2019s subsidiaries in Germany and Ukraine devised several schemes to bribe Ukraine government officials to release the money. The bribes paid were generally 18 to 20 percent of the corresponding VAT refunds. For example, the subsidiaries artificially inflated commodities contracts with a Ukrainian shipping company to provide bribe payments to government officials. In another scheme, the subsidiaries created phony insurance contracts with an insurance company that included false premiums passed on to Ukraine government officials. The misconduct went unchecked by ADM for several years because of its deficient and decentralized system of FCPA oversight over subsidiaries in Germany and Ukraine.\" (Source: US Securities and Exchange Commission, \"SEC Charges Archer-Daniels-Midland Company With FCPA Violations,\" December 20, 2013.)",

        "Summary": "According to the UK Financial Conduct Authority's Final Notice, \"4.1. Besso is the broking subsidiary of Besso Insurance Group Limited. Besso is a medium-sized Lloyd\u2019s general insurance broker operating mainly in the commercial sector, specialising in marine, aviation, transport, property, casualty, international and liability insurance. Besso has been authorised by the Authority\n to carry out a number of regulated activities since 14 January 2005. This includes assisting in the administration and performance of contracts of insurance.\n 4.2. Insurance and reinsurance brokers such as Besso make payments to, and share commission with, Third Parties in a number of circumstances. For example, a broker may pay a co-broker who assists in the placement of insurance or reinsurance. In some cases, a broker may pay a broker who provides services (e.g., administrative and policy insurance services) in relation to the placement of\n insurance in countries where the principal broker does not have an office. In other cases, a broker may pay individuals or companies who have limited or no involvement in placement activities, but assist with client introductions and providing relevant market and other information.\n 4.3. Being a wholesale broker, Besso was heavily reliant upon Producing Brokers to bring business to it. The Producing Brokers would have the relationship with the insured and would handle all correspondence in relation to that insured. Besso would normally agree a split of commission between the Producing Broker and itself.\n 4.4. During the Relevant Period, Besso offered (and continues to offer) broking services for both insurance and reinsurance business across a wide range of industries and countries, which will have had a varying degree of perceived risk of bribery and corruption. In establishing and maintaining business relationships, Besso made use of, and paid commissions to, Third Parties (both overseas and in the UK). Accordingly, although it was not unusual or inappropriate for Besso to make payments to Third Parties, there was a risk, which was increased for higher risk industries and countries, that a proportion of the money paid to Third Parties might have been used by the Third Parties for inappropriate purposes. This could have included paying bribes to persons connected with the insured or public officials.\" (Source: UK FCA FInal Notice, File Reference Number 309159, March 17, 2014.)",

BHPB invited approximately 176 government officials and employees of state-owned enterprises (collectively, \u201cgovernment officials\u201d) to attend the Olympics at BHPB\u2019s expense. The majority of these invitations were extended to government officials from countries in Africa and Asia that had well-known histories of corruption. The three to four day hospitality packages included event tickets, luxury hotel accommodations, meals, other hospitality, and, in many instances, offers of business-class airfare for government officials and their guests. BHPB informed its employees that \u201c[o]ne of the core objectives [of the Olympic sponsorship] is to maximize the commercial investment made in the Games through assisting [BHPB] to strengthen relationships with key local and global stakeholders, e.g.: Government Ministers, Suppliers and Customers,\u201d and that the hospitality program was \u201ca primary vehicle to ensure this goal is achieved.\u201d\r\n \r\n 2. BHPB recognized that inviting government officials to the Olympics created a heightened risk of violating anti-corruption laws and the company\u2019s own Guide to Business Conduct, but the internal controls it developed and relied upon in an effort to address this risk were insufficient. As a result, BHPB invited government officials who were directly involved in, or in a position to influence, pending contract negotiations, efforts to obtain access rights, regulatory actions, or business dealings affecting BHPB in multiple countries. In addition, BHPB\u2019s books and records, namely certain internal forms that employees prepared in order to invite a government official to the Olympics, did not, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect BHPB\u2019s pending\r\n negotiations or business dealings with the government official at the time of the invitation.\" (Source: SEC Administrative Proceedings, File No. 3-16546, In the Matter of BHP Billiton Ltd. and BHP Billiton Plc, May 20, 2015.)",

        "Summary": "According to the US Department of Justice, \"Parker Drilling Company, a publicly listed drilling-services company, headquartered in Houston, has agreed to pay an $11.76 million penalty to resolve charges related to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) for authorizing payment to an intermediary, knowing that the payment would be used to corruptly influence the decisions of a Nigerian government panel reviewing Parker Drilling\u2019s adherence to Nigerian customs and tax laws. [ ] \r\n \r\n The investigation of Parker Drilling stemmed from the Justice Department\u2019s Panalpina-related investigations, which previously yielded criminal resolutions with Panalpina and five oil and gas service companies and subsidiaries and resulted in more than $156 million in criminal penalties. [ ] \r\n  \r\n According to court documents, in 2001 and 2002, Panalpina World Transport (Nigeria) Limited, working on Parker Drilling\u2019s behalf, avoided certain costs associated with complying with Nigeria\u2019s customs laws by fraudulently claiming that Parker Drilling\u2019s rigs had been exported and then re-imported into Nigeria. In late 2002, Nigeria formed a government commission, commonly called the Temporary Import (TI) Panel, to examine whether Nigeria\u2019s Customs Service had collected certain duties and tariffs that Nigeria was due. In December 2002, the TI Panel commenced proceedings against Parker Drilling. The TI Panel later determined that Parker Drilling had violated Nigeria\u2019s customs laws and assessed a $3.8 million fine against Parker Drilling.\r\n \r\n According to court documents, rather than pay the assessed fine, Parker Drilling contracted indirectly with an intermediary agent to resolve its customs issues. From January to May 2004, Parker Drilling transferred $1.25 million to the agent, who reported spending a portion of the money on various things including entertaining government officials. Emails in which the agent requested additional money from Parker Drilling referenced the agent\u2019s interactions with Nigeria\u2019s Ministry of Finance, State Security Service, and a delegation from the president\u2019s office. Two senior executives within Parker Drilling at the time reviewed and approved the agent\u2019s invoices, knowing that the invoices arbitrarily attributed portions of the money that Parker Drilling transferred to the agent to various fees and expenses. The agent succeeded in reducing Parker Drilling\u2019s TI Panel fines from $3.8 million to just $750,000.\" (Source: DOJ Press Release, \"Parker Drilling Company Resolves FCPA Investigation and Agrees to Pay $11.76 Million Penalty,\" April 16, 2013.)",

        "Summary": "According to the US Securities and Exchange Commission, Brucker Corporation, a Billerica, Mass.-based global manufacturer of scientific instruments was charged \"with violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) by providing non-business related travel and improper payments to various Chinese government officials in an effort to win business. \n \n An SEC investigation found that Bruker Corporation lacked sufficient internal controls to prevent and detect approximately $230,000 in improper payments out of its China-based offices that falsely recorded them in books and records as legitimate business and marketing expenses. The payments enabled Bruker to realize approximately $1.7 million in profits from sales contracts with state-owned entities in China whose officials received the improper payments. [ ] \n \n According to the SEC\u2019s order instituting a settled administrative proceeding, a Bruker office in China paid more than $111,000 to Chinese government officials under 12 suspicious collaboration agreements contingent on state-owned entities providing research on Bruker products or using Bruker products in demonstration laboratories. The collaboration agreements did not specify the work product that the state-owned entities had to provide in order to be paid, and no work product was actually provided to the Bruker office by the state-owned entities. Certain collaboration agreements were executed directly with a Chinese government official rather than the state-owned entity itself, and in some cases Bruker\u2019s office paid the official directly. \n \n According to the SEC\u2019s order, the other improper payments involved reimbursements to Chinese government officials for leisure travel to the United States, Czech Republic, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, Switzerland, and Italy. These officials often were responsible for authorizing the purchase of Bruker products, and the leisure trips typically followed business-related travel for the officials funded by the company. For example, Bruker paid for the purported training expenses of a Chinese government official who signed the sales contract on behalf of a state-owned entity, but the payment actually was reimbursement for sightseeing, tour tickets, shopping, and other leisure activities in Frankfurt and Paris. Bruker also funded some trips for Chinese government officials that had no legitimate business component.

        "Summary": "According to the US Securities and Exchange Commission, \"the global markets group at broker-dealer Direct Access Partners (DAP) executed fixed income trades for customers in foreign sovereign debt. DAP Global generated more than $66 million in revenue for DAP from transaction fees - in the form of markups and markdowns - on riskless principal trade executions in Venezuelan sovereign or state-sponsored bonds for Banco de Desarrollo Econ\u00f3mico y Social de Venezuela (BANDES). A portion of this revenue was illicitly paid to BANDES Vice President of Finance, Mar\u00eda de los \u00c1ngeles Gonz\u00e1lez de Hernandez, who authorized the fraudulent trades. [ ] \r\n \r\n The SEC's complaint charges the following individuals for the roles in the kickback scheme:\r\n \r\n Tomas Alberto Clarke Bethancourt, who lives in Miami and is an executive vice president at DAP. Known as \"Tomas Clarke,\" he was responsible for executing the fraudulent trades and maintaining spreadsheets tracking the illicit markups and markdowns on those trades.\r\n Iuri Rodolfo Bethancourt, who lives in Panama and received more than $20 million in fraudulent proceeds from DAP via his Panamanian shell company, which then paid Gonzalez a portion of this amount.\r\n Jose Alejandro Hurtado, who lives in Miami and served as the intermediary between DAP and Gonzalez. Hurtado was paid more than $6 million in kickbacks disguised as salary payments from DAP, and he remitted some of that money to Gonzalez.\r\n Haydee Leticia Pabon, who is Hurtado's wife and received approximately $8 million in markups or markdowns on BANDES trades that were funneled to her from DAP in the form of sham finders' fees. [ ]\r\n \r\n According to the SEC's complaint, the scheme began in October 2008 and continued until at least June 2010. BANDES was a new customer to DAP brought in by DAP Global executives through their connections to Hurtado. As a result of the kickbacks to Gonzalez, DAP obtained BANDES' lucrative trading business and provided Gonzalez with the incentive to enter into trades with DAP at considerable markups or markdowns without regard to the prices paid by BANDES. Gonzalez used her senior role at the Caracas-based bank to ensure that its bond trades would continue to be steered to DAP. As the scheme evolved over time, the traders deceived DAP's clearing brokers, executed internal wash trades, inter-positioned another broker-dealer in the trades to conceal their role in the transactions, and engaged in massive roundtrip trades to pad their revenue.\r\n \r\n For example, the SEC alleges that in January 2010, the traders and Gonzalez arranged for two fraudulent roundtrip trades with BANDES as both buyer and seller.

        "Summary": "According to the US Securities and Exchange Commission, \"the global markets group at broker-dealer Direct Access Partners (DAP) executed fixed income trades for customers in foreign sovereign debt. DAP Global generated more than $66 million in revenue for DAP from transaction fees - in the form of markups and markdowns - on riskless principal trade executions in Venezuelan sovereign or state-sponsored bonds for Banco de Desarrollo Econ\u00f3mico y Social de Venezuela (BANDES). A portion of this revenue was illicitly paid to BANDES Vice President of Finance, Mar\u00eda de los \u00c1ngeles Gonz\u00e1lez de Hernandez, who authorized the fraudulent trades. [ ] \n \n The SEC's complaint charges the following individuals for the roles in the kickback scheme:\n \n Tomas Alberto Clarke Bethancourt, who lives in Miami and is an executive vice president at DAP. Known as \"Tomas Clarke,\" he was responsible for executing the fraudulent trades and maintaining spreadsheets tracking the illicit markups and markdowns on those trades.\n Iuri Rodolfo Bethancourt, who lives in Panama and received more than $20 million in fraudulent proceeds from DAP via his Panamanian shell company, which then paid Gonzalez a portion of this amount.\n Jose Alejandro Hurtado, who lives in Miami and served as the intermediary between DAP and Gonzalez. Hurtado was paid more than $6 million in kickbacks disguised as salary payments from DAP, and he remitted some of that money to Gonzalez.\n Haydee Leticia Pabon, who is Hurtado's wife and received approximately $8 million in markups or markdowns on BANDES trades that were funneled to her from DAP in the form of sham finders' fees. [ ]\n \n According to the SEC's complaint, the scheme began in October 2008 and continued until at least June 2010. BANDES was a new customer to DAP brought in by DAP Global executives through their connections to Hurtado. As a result of the kickbacks to Gonzalez, DAP obtained BANDES' lucrative trading business and provided Gonzalez with the incentive to enter into trades with DAP at considerable markups or markdowns without regard to the prices paid by BANDES. Gonzalez used her senior role at the Caracas-based bank to ensure that its bond trades would continue to be steered to DAP. As the scheme evolved over time, the traders deceived DAP's clearing brokers, executed internal wash trades, inter-positioned another broker-dealer in the trades to conceal their role in the transactions, and engaged in massive roundtrip trades to pad their revenue.\n \n For example, the SEC alleges that in January 2010, the traders and Gonzalez arranged for two fraudulent roundtrip trades with BANDES as both buyer and seller. These trades - which lacked any legitimate business purpose - caused BANDES to pay DAP more than $10 million in fees, a portion of which was diverted to Gonzalez for authorizing the blatantly fraudulent trades.\n \n The SEC further alleges that, giving rise to the adage of no honor among thieves, Clarke and Hurtado frequently falsified the size of DAP's fees in their reports to Gonzalez, which enabled the traders to retain a greater share of the fraudulent profits.\" (Source: US SEC Press Release,\"SEC Charges Traders in Massive Kickback Scheme Involving Venezuelan Official,\" May 7, 2013.) \n \n In April 2014, Benito Chinea and Joseph DeMeneses were added to the SEC's complaint.

        "Summary": "According to the US Department of Justice, \"Ernesto Lujan, Jose Alejandro Hurtado and Tomas Alberto Clarke Bethancourt pleaded guilty in New York federal court to conspiring to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), to violate the Travel Act and to commit money laundering, as well as substantive counts of these offenses. These charges relate to a scheme to bribe a foreign official named Maria de los Angeles Gonzalez de Hernandez at Banco de Desarrollo Econ\u00f3mico y Social de Venezuela (BANDES), a state economic development bank in Venezuela, in exchange for receiving trading business from BANDES. Lujan, Hurtado and Clarke each also pleaded guilty to an additional charge of conspiring to violate the FCPA in connection with a similar scheme to bribe a foreign official employed by Banfoandes (the \u201cBanfoandes Foreign Official\u201d), another state economic development bank in Venezuela, and to conspiring to obstruct an examination by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) of the New York-based broker-dealer (the \u201cBroker-Dealer\u201d) where all three defendants had worked, to conceal the true facts of the Broker-Dealer\u2019s relationship with BANDES. [ ] \r\n \r\n Lujan, Clarke and Hurtado worked or were associated with the Broker-Dealer, principally through its Miami offices. In 2008, the Broker-Dealer established a group called the Global Markets Group, which included Lujan, Clarke and Hurtado, and which offered fixed income trading services to institutional clients. \r\n \r\n One of the Broker-Dealer\u2019s clients was BANDES, which operated under the direction of the Venezuelan Ministry of Finance. The Venezuelan government had a majority ownership interest in BANDES and provided it with substantial funding. Gonzalez was an official at BANDES and oversaw the development bank\u2019s overseas trading activity. At her direction, BANDES conducted substantial trading through the Broker-Dealer. Most of the trades executed by the Broker-Dealer on behalf of BANDES involved fixed-income investments for which the Broker-Dealer charged the bank a mark-up on purchases and a mark-down on sales. \r\n \r\n The Broker-Dealer also conducted business with Banfoandes, another state development bank in Venezuela that, along with its 2009 successor Banco Bicentenario, operated under the direction of the Venezuelan Ministry of Finance. Banfoandes acted as a financial agent of the Venezuelan government in order to promote economic and social development by, among other things, offering credit to low-income Venezuelans. The Banfoandes Foreign Official was responsible for some of Banfoandes\u2019s foreign investments.\r\n \r\n Court records state that from early 2009 through 2012, Lujan, Clarke and Hurtado participated in a bribery scheme in which Gonzalez allegedly directed trading business she controlled at BANDES to the Broker-Dealer, and in return, agents and employees of the Broker-Dealer split the revenue the Broker-Dealer generated from this trading business with Gonzalez. During this time period, the Broker-Dealer generated over $60 million in mark-ups and mark-downs from trades with BANDES.

Specifically, Gonzalez allegedly received kickbacks and payments from Broker-Dealer agents and employees that were frequently in six-figure amounts.\r\n \r\n To further conceal the scheme, the kickbacks to Gonzalez were often paid using intermediary corporations and offshore accounts that she held in Switzerland, among other places. For instance, Lujan, Clarke and Hurtado used accounts they controlled in Switzerland to transfer funds to an account Gonzalez allegedly controlled in Switzerland. Additionally, Hurtado and his spouse received substantial compensation from the Broker-Dealer, portions of which Hurtado transferred to an account allegedly held by Gonzalez in Miami and to an account held by an associate of Gonzalez in Switzerland. Hurtado also sought and allegedly received reimbursement from Gonzalez for the U.S. income taxes he had paid on money that he used to make kickback payments to Gonzalez.

These charges relate to a scheme to bribe a foreign official named Maria de los Angeles Gonzalez de Hernandez at Banco de Desarrollo Econ\u00f3mico y Social de Venezuela (BANDES), a state economic development bank in Venezuela, in exchange for receiving trading business from BANDES. Lujan, Hurtado and Clarke each also pleaded guilty to an additional charge of conspiring to violate the FCPA in connection with a similar scheme to bribe a foreign official employed by Banfoandes (the \u201cBanfoandes Foreign Official\u201d), another state economic development bank in Venezuela, and to conspiring to obstruct an examination by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) of the New York-based broker-dealer (the \u201cBroker-Dealer\u201d) where all three defendants had worked, to conceal the true facts of the Broker-Dealer\u2019s relationship with BANDES. [ ] \r\n \r\n Lujan, Clarke and Hurtado worked or were associated with the Broker-Dealer, principally through its Miami offices. In 2008, the Broker-Dealer established a group called the Global Markets Group, which included Lujan, Clarke and Hurtado, and which offered fixed income trading services to institutional clients. \r\n \r\n One of the Broker-Dealer\u2019s clients was BANDES, which operated under the direction of the Venezuelan Ministry of Finance. The Venezuelan government had a majority ownership interest in BANDES and provided it with substantial funding. Gonzalez was an official at BANDES and oversaw the development bank\u2019s overseas trading activity. At her direction, BANDES conducted substantial trading through the Broker-Dealer. Most of the trades executed by the Broker-Dealer on behalf of BANDES involved fixed-income investments for which the Broker-Dealer charged the bank a mark-up on purchases and a mark-down on sales. \r\n \r\n The Broker-Dealer also conducted business with Banfoandes, another state development bank in Venezuela that, along with its 2009 successor Banco Bicentenario, operated under the direction of the Venezuelan Ministry of Finance. Banfoandes acted as a financial agent of the Venezuelan government in order to promote economic and social development by, among other things, offering credit to low-income Venezuelans. The Banfoandes Foreign Official was responsible for some of Banfoandes\u2019s foreign investments.\r\n \r\n Court records state that from early 2009 through 2012, Lujan, Clarke and Hurtado participated in a bribery scheme in which Gonzalez allegedly directed trading business she controlled at BANDES to the Broker-Dealer, and in return, agents and employees of the Broker-Dealer split the revenue the Broker-Dealer generated from this trading business with Gonzalez. During this time period, the Broker-Dealer generated over $60 million in mark-ups and mark-downs from trades with BANDES.

        "Summary": "According to the US Securities and Exchange Commission, \"the global markets group at broker-dealer Direct Access Partners (DAP) executed fixed income trades for customers in foreign sovereign debt. DAP Global generated more than $66 million in revenue for DAP from transaction fees - in the form of markups and markdowns - on riskless principal trade executions in Venezuelan sovereign or state-sponsored bonds for Banco de Desarrollo Econ\u00f3mico y Social de Venezuela (BANDES). A portion of this revenue was illicitly paid to BANDES Vice President of Finance, Mar\u00eda de los \u00c1ngeles Gonz\u00e1lez de Hernandez, who authorized the fraudulent trades. [ ] \r\n \r\n The SEC's complaint charges the following individuals for the roles in the kickback scheme:\r\n \r\n Tomas Alberto Clarke Bethancourt, who lives in Miami and is an executive vice president at DAP. Known as \"Tomas Clarke,\" he was responsible for executing the fraudulent trades and maintaining spreadsheets tracking the illicit markups and markdowns on those trades.\r\n Iuri Rodolfo Bethancourt, who lives in Panama and received more than $20 million in fraudulent proceeds from DAP via his Panamanian shell company, which then paid Gonzalez a portion of this amount.\r\n Jose Alejandro Hurtado, who lives in Miami and served as the intermediary between DAP and Gonzalez. Hurtado was paid more than $6 million in kickbacks disguised as salary payments from DAP, and he remitted some of that money to Gonzalez.\r\n Haydee Leticia Pabon, who is Hurtado's wife and received approximately $8 million in markups or markdowns on BANDES trades that were funneled to her from DAP in the form of sham finders' fees. [ ]\r\n \r\n According to the SEC's complaint, the scheme began in October 2008 and continued until at least June 2010. BANDES was a new customer to DAP brought in by DAP Global executives through their connections to Hurtado. As a result of the kickbacks to Gonzalez, DAP obtained BANDES' lucrative trading business and provided Gonzalez with the incentive to enter into trades with DAP at considerable markups or markdowns without regard to the prices paid by BANDES. Gonzalez used her senior role at the Caracas-based bank to ensure that its bond trades would continue to be steered to DAP. As the scheme evolved over time, the traders deceived DAP's clearing brokers, executed internal wash trades, inter-positioned another broker-dealer in the trades to conceal their role in the transactions, and engaged in massive roundtrip trades to pad their revenue.\r\n \r\n For example, the SEC alleges that in January 2010, the traders and Gonzalez arranged for two fraudulent roundtrip trades with BANDES as both buyer and seller. These trades - which lacked any legitimate business purpose - caused BANDES to pay DAP more than $10 million in fees, a portion of which was diverted to Gonzalez for authorizing the blatantly fraudulent trades.\r\n \r\n The SEC further alleges that, giving rise to the adage of no honor among thieves, Clarke and Hurtado frequently falsified the size of DAP's fees in their reports to Gonzalez, which enabled the traders to retain a greater share of the fraudulent profits.\" (Source: US SEC Press Release,\"SEC Charges Traders in Massive Kickback Scheme Involving Venezuelan Official,\" May 7, 2013.) \r\n \r\n In April 2014, Benito Chinea and Joseph DeMeneses were added to the SEC's complaint. In 2016, seven defendants in the case were ordered to forfeit $42,506,171, which was deemed satisfied by the criminal judgments imposed against them.

Cilins also sought to induce the witness to sign an affidavit containing false statements regarding matters under investigation by the grand jury.

(\"Griffiths Energy\" or \"the Company\") announced today that it reached a settlement and resolution with respect to a previously disclosed charge under section 3(1)(b) of Canada's Corruption of Foreign Public Officials Act (\"CFPOA\").\r\n \r\n As previously disclosed, the matter involved certain contracts entered into by the prior management and Board of Directors of Griffiths Energy during the period between August 30, 2009 and February 9, 2011. Prior management entered into consulting contracts (the \"Contracts\") with two entities owned and controlled by a foreign public official and his spouse. At a court hearing on Tuesday the Company entered a guilty plea to the charge before the Court of Queen's Bench in Calgary, Alberta and agreed to pay a total fine of C$10.35 million. Today the Court accepted the settlement.\r\n \r\n \"Griffiths Energy regrets the actions of the prior management and Board. When we discovered the contracts we blew the whistle and cooperated with the authorities because this is how Griffiths Energy's current management and board conduct business,\" said Gary Guidry, President and Chief Executive Officer. \"The negotiated resolution addresses the interests of all stakeholders. Now that the matter is closed, Griffiths Energy can focus all of its attention on oil exploration, development and production in Chad.\"\r\n \r\n In November 2011, as previously announced, Griffiths Energy voluntarily disclosed to the appropriate authorities that it had commenced an internal investigation into the Contracts. The exhaustive investigation, supervised by a special committee of independent directors of the Board and conducted by external legal counsel, was concluded in May 2012. At that time Griffiths Energy voluntarily shared the results with appropriate authorities and worked with them to conclude the matter today.\r\n \r\n The Company affirms that no influence was actually obtained as a result of providing the benefits to the foreign public official, and that the award of its Production Sharing Contracts was not in any way connected to the improper promises and benefits indirectly provided to the foreign public official. These proceedings have no impact on the security and veracity of the Company's significant license area in Chad and the case is now closed.\r\n \r\n Griffiths Energy's conduct since the discovery of these contracts, and the proactive and responsible steps taken by the current management and Board to immediately self-disclose these issues to law enforcement, were described at length by counsel and were considered by the Court to be significant factors in agreeing to the resolution that was jointly recommended by counsel to the Company and the Crown. The Court also took favourable notice that Griffiths Energy was prepared to self-disclose even though Canada had not yet established policies or protocols governing such voluntary disclosures, and Griffiths Energy received no tangible concessions from the authorities when it self-reported.\" (Source: \"Griffiths Energy International Announces Settlement,\" Canada News Wire, January 25, 2013, at http://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/griffiths-energy-international-announces-settlement-511886831.html)",

        "Summary": "According to the US Department of Justice, the Russian subsidiary of the Hewlett-Packard company pleaded guilty to violation of FCPA charges: \"According to curt documents, in 1999, the Russian government announced a project to automate the computer and telecommunications infrastructure of its Office of the Prosecutor General of the Russian Federation (GPO). Not only was that project itself worth more than $100 million, but HP Russia viewed it as the \u201cgolden key\u201d that could unlock the door to another $100 to $150 million dollars in business with Russian government agencies. To secure a contract for the first phase of project, ultimately valued at more than \u20ac 35 million, HP Russia executives and other employees structured the deal to create a secret slush fund totaling several million dollars, at least part of which was intended for bribes to Russian government officials.\r\n \r\n As admitted in a statement of facts, HP Russia created excess profit margins for the slush fund through an elaborate buyback\r\n deal structure, whereby (1) HP sold the computer hardware and other technology products called for under the contract to a Russian channel partner, (2) HP bought the same products back from an intermediary company at a nearly \u20ac8 million markup and paid the intermediary an additional \u20ac4.2 million for purported services, and (3) HP sold the same products to the GPO at the increased price. The payments to the intermediary were then largely transferred through a cascading series of shell companies \u2013 some of which were directly associated with government officials \u2013 registered in the United States, United Kingdom, British Virgin Islands and Belize. Much of these payments from the intermediary were laundered through offshore bank accounts in Switzerland, Lithuania, Latvia and Austria. Portions of the funds were spent on travel, cars, jewelry, clothing, expensive watches, swimming pool technology, furniture, household appliances and other luxury goods. To keep track of these corrupt payments, the conspirators inside HP Russia kept two sets of books: secret spreadsheets that detailed the categories of recipients of the corrupt funds and sanitized versions that hid the corrupt payments from others outside of HP Russia. They also entered into offthebooks side agreements. As one example, an HP Russia executive executed a letter agreement to pay \u20ac2.8 million in purported \u201ccommission\u201d fees to a U.K.registered shell company, which was linked to a director of the Russian government agency responsible for managing the GPO project. HP Russia never disclosed the existence of the agreement to internal or external auditors or management outside of HP Russia and conducted no due diligence of the shell company.\" (Source: US Department of Justice Press Release, \"HewlettPackard Russia Agrees to Plead Guilty to Foreign Bribery,\" April 4, 2014.)",

The company transferred an additional $8 million to the consultant to cover the costs of operating the team without any documentation of those costs.\r\n \r\n LVS used the same consultant as a beard to purchase a building in Beijing from a Chinese state-owned-entity, ostensibly to develop a business center for U.S. companies seeking to do business in China. Despite concerns by some employees that the real estate purchase was solely for political purposes, approximately $43 million in payments were made to the consultant without research, analysis, or proper approval by any LVS employee authorized to approve the amounts paid. \r\n \r\n Approximately $900,000 paid to an entity controlled by the consultant was recorded in company books and records as \u201cproperty management fees\u201d when no property management services were actually performed. Approximately $1.4 million was recorded as \u201carts and crafts\u201d when the entity never actually obtained any artwork for the building.\r\n LVS failed to prevent employees from circumventing policies and procedures for purchases, reimbursements to outside counsel, and comps to customers. For example, one employee obtained a cash advance of $28,000 and a cash reimbursement of $86,000 without proper authorization. An outside counsel requested reimbursement of $25,000 for expenses incurred on a business trip but provided no documentation, and later admitted that he actually requested the funds for a friend. In its casinos in Macao, LVS employees did not track which customers received comps to ensure they weren\u2019t providing improper gifts to government officials.\" (Source: SEC Press Release, \"Las Vegas Sands Paying Penalty for FCPA Violations,\" April 7, 2016.)",

At the time, [Mr. Ellery was] the chief financial officer, and a company secretary, of Securency International Pty Ltd\r\n (\u201cSecurency\u201d).\r\n 3 Securency is an Australian company, which is jointly owned by the Reserve Bank of Australia and a British company, Innovia Films BVBA. Securency manufactures and supplies a range of unique substances used in banknotes and security documents.\r\n Its polymer substrate product is used by various people, including another Reserve Bank subsidiary, Note Printing Australia Limited (\u201cNote Printing\u201d), in the printing\r\n of banknotes.\r\n 4 In 1999 and 2000, Note Printing and Securency each negotiated and entered into separate agreements with a Malaysian man, Abdul Kayum Syed Ahmad (\u201cKayum\u201d),\r\n and/or his company, Aksavest Sdn Bhd, appointing them as their agent in Malaysia.\r\n The agency agreements provided that the agent was to be remunerated in the form of success-based commissions, based on the contracts which the agent obtained for the relevant company. The agent was to bear the cost of any expenses incurred in order to obtain contracts.\r\n 5 In December 2003, Note Printing entered into a contract to supply Bank Negara Malaysia with 160 million 5 ringgit polymer banknotes. Securency was not a party to the banknote contract. Note Printing used Securency\u2019s polymer substrate in manufacturing the banknotes, and the contract price of $15.2 million included a price for that substrate. Note Printing paid Kayum substantial commission payments, in respect of the 2003 contract.\r\n 6 The Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions has brought charges against Securency, Note Printing, and various former officers of the two companies, alleging\r\n that they conspired with each other and with Kayum, between October 2001 and December 2003, to offer bribes to officials in the Malaysian bank, in order to obtain the business of supplying 5 ringgit polymer banknotes. The DPP alleges that the bribes were to be paid from the commission payable to Kayum.\r\n 7 The DPP does not allege that [Mr. Ellery was] a participant in the alleged Malaysian conspiracy, or that [he was] involved in it when, in mid-2006, [he] committed the false accounting offence to which [he has] pleaded guilty.\" (Source: R v.

The investigation was closed after SIT admitted inadequate enforcement of compliance regulations in relation to Yamal gas pipeline projects and paid CHF 125,000 in reparation. SIT also paid US$ 10.6 million in compensation for unlawfully obtained profits.\r\n \r\nThe OAG investigated the circumstances behind contracts awarded to the Swedish company, acquired by Siemens in 2003, for the supply of gas turbines during the construction of the pipeline, which runs from the gas fields on the Russian Yamal peninsula to Western Europe. In the course of project, initiated by Russia's largest natural gas production company, bribes were paid to senior executives of the Russian state-owned company. SIT made the unlawful payments between 2004 and 2006 via bank accounts held by the end recipients in Switzerland. This was the connecting factor that gave rise to the OAG's investigation.\r\n \r\n The SIT accepts that it did not take all the required and reasonable organisational steps to prevent bribes being paid to foreign public officials in connection with projects to build compressor stations and to supply gas turbines for the Yamal pipeline network. In particular, it admitted basic failures in checking consultancy agreements. The company is therefore guilty of organisational offences under Art. 102 of the Swiss Criminal Code (SCC). SIT has paid reparation of CHF 125,000 in the form of a donation to the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).\r\n \r\n As a consequence, the OAG closed the investigation into SIT based on Art. 53 SCC and at the same time ordered the forfeiture of unlawfully obtained assets. The profits obtained unlawfully from the projects concerned amount to US$ 10.6 million. The OAG ordered SIT to pay a corresponding sum in compensation to the State (Art. 71 para. 1 SCC).

Smith & Wesson officials authorized the agent to provide more than $11,000 worth of guns to Pakistani police officials as gifts, and then make additional cash payments. Smith & Wesson ultimately won a contract to sell 548 pistols to the Pakistani police for a profit of $107,852.\r\n \r\n The SEC\u2019s order finds that Smith & Wesson employees made or authorized improper payments related to multiple other pending or contemplated international sales contracts. For example, in 2009, Smith & Wesson attempted to win a contract to sell firearms to an Indonesian police department by making improper payments to its third party agent in Indonesia. The agent indicated he would provide a portion of that money to Indonesian officials under the guise of legitimate firearm lab testing costs. He said Indonesian police officials expected to be paid additional amounts above the actual cost of testing the guns.

The mandate to raise the funds was placed with Standard Bank and Stanbic and US $600 million was raised but there is no evidence that EGMA provided any services in relation to the transaction. Meanwhile, EGMA had opened a bank account with Stanbic and its fee of US $6 million was paid (as agreed) via Stanbic into the account. Very shortly thereafter the vast majority of the sum had been withdrawn in cash. The withdrawals excited the concern of staff at Stanbic who referred the matter to the head office of Standard Bank Group Ltd; Standard Bank were alerted and very quickly thereafter, a law firm was appointed to investigate the matter and, within three weeks of the first report, both the Serious and Organised Crime Agency and the SFO were informed.\" The Judgment also makes note of Standard Bank's settlement with the US Securities and Exchange Commission.

        "Summary": "According to the US Securities and Exchange Commission, Standard Bank Plc was charged \"with failing to disclose certain payments in connection with debt issued by the Government of Tanzania in 2013. The London-based bank acted as a lead manager for the offering and failed to disclose payments made by an affiliate to a Tanzanian firm that received a portion of the proceeds of the $600 million offering but performed no substantive role in the transaction.\r\n \r\n Standard Bank, now ICBC Standard Bank Plc, agreed to settle the SEC\u2019s charges by paying a $4.2 million penalty and admitting the facts underlying the SEC\u2019s charges that were admitted in a related settlement with the United Kingdom\u2019s Serious Fraud Office (SFO). As part of that coordinated global settlement, the SFO also announced a settlement today in an action it brought against Standard in the U.K. for Standard\u2019s violations of Section 7 of the U.K.\u2019s Bribery Act of 2010. The Bribery Act of 2010 is similar to the Unites States\u2019 Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). The SEC would not have jurisdiction to bring charges under the FCPA because Standard was not an \u201cissuer\u201d as defined by that Act. Standard will pay a total of approximately $36.9 million in monetary relief in the SEC and U.K. actions. \r\n \r\n [Accordng to the SEC's Cease and Desist] order,] the offering documents and statements to potential investors in the sovereign debt offering were materially misleading because they failed to disclose that Standard\u2019s affiliate, Stanbic Bank Tanzania Limited, would pay $6 million of the proceeds to Enterprise Growth Markets Advisors Limited (EGMA), a private Tanzanian firm. The order found Standard did not seek to understand EGMA\u2019s role in the transaction despite red flags that the $6 million payment was intended to induce the Government of Tanzania to select Standard and Stanbic as managers for the offering. One of EGMA\u2019s directors was a representative of the Government of Tanzania and the offering was not finalized until Standard and Stanbic committed to pay EGMA one percent of the proceeds of the offering. Standard and Stanbic split 1.4 percent of the proceeds, with each receiving $4.2 million for their participation in the transaction. [ ] \r\n \r\n The SEC\u2019s order requires Standard to cease and desist from committing or causing any violations and any future violations of Section 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 that prohibits obtaining money by any materially untrue statement or omission, and to pay a $4.2 million civil penalty. The order also requires Standard to pay disgorgement of $8.4 million, which the Commission has deemed satisfied by a payment of equal amount in the U.K. matter.\" (Source: US SEC Press Release, \"Standard Bank to Pay $4.2 Million to Settle SEC Charges Bank Agrees to $36.9 Million Global Settlement with the SEC and the U.K.\u2019s Serious Fraud Office,\" November 30, 2015.)",

Overall, Tyco reaped illicit benefits amounting to more than $10.5 million as a result of the paid to win business.\r\n \r\n Tyco, whose securities are publicly traded in the U.S., agreed to pay more than $26 million to settle the SEC\u2019s charges and resolve a criminal matter announced today by the U.S. Department of Justice. [ ] \r\n \r\n The SEC alleges that Tyco subsidiaries operated 12 different illicit payment schemes around the world starting before 2006 and continuing until 2009. The most profitable scheme occurred in Germany, where agents of a Tyco subsidiary paid third parties to secure contracts or avoid penalties or fines in several countries. These payments were falsely recorded as \u201ccommissions\u201d in Tyco\u2019s books and records when they were in fact bribes to pay off government customers. Tyco\u2019s benefit as a result of these illicit payments was more than $4.6 million.\r\n \r\n According to the SEC\u2019s complaint, Tyco\u2019s subsidiary in China signed a contract with the Chinese Ministry of Public Security for $770,000 but reportedly paid approximately $3,700 to the \u201csite project team\u201d of a state-owned corporation to be able to obtain the contract. This amount was improperly recorded as a commission. Tyco\u2019s subsidiary in France recorded payments to individuals from 2005 to 2009 for \u201cbusiness introduction services.\u201d However, one of the individuals receiving payments was a security officer at a government-owned mining company in Mauritania, and many of the earlier payments were deposited in the official\u2019s personal bank account in France. In Thailand, Tyco\u2019s subsidiary had a contract to install a CCTV system in the Thai Parliament House in 2006, and paid more than $50,000 to a Thai entity that acted as a consultant. The invoice for the payment refers to \u201crenovation work,\u201d but Tyco is unable to ascertain what, if any, work was actually done.\r\n \r\n The SEC alleges that another scheme occurred in Turkey, where Tyco\u2019s subsidiary retained a New York City-based sales agent who made illicit payments involving the sale of microwave equipment in September 2006 to an entity controlled by the Turkish government. Employees at Tyco\u2019s subsidiary were well aware that the agent was paying foreign government customers to obtain orders. One internal e-mail stated, \u201cHell, everyone knows you have to bribe somebody to do business in Turkey. Nevertheless, I\u2019ll play it dumb if [the sales agent] should call.\u201d The benefit obtained by Tyco as a result of the September 2006 deal was $44,513.\" (Source: US Securities and Exchange Commission, Litigation Release No. 22491, \"SEC Charges TYCO with Making Illicit Payments to Foreign Officials,\" September 24, 2012.)",

[ ] According to the companies\u2019 admissions, VimpelCom and Unitel, through various executives and employees, paid bribes to an Uzbek government official, who was a close relative of a high ranking government official and had influence over the Uzbek governmental body that regulated the telecom industry. The companies structured and concealed the bribes through various payments to a shell company that certain VimpelCom and Unitel management knew was beneficially owned by the foreign official. The bribes were paid on multiple\r\n occasions between approximately 2006 and 2012 so that VimpelCom could enter the Uzbek market and Unitel could gain valuable telecom assets and continue operating in Uzbekistan. VimpelCom and Unitel contemplated additional bribes in 2013, but those bribes were not completed before VimpelCom opened an internal investigation.\r\n In addition, VimpelCom admitted that it falsified its books and records and attempted to conceal and disguise the bribery scheme by classifying payments as equity transactions, consulting and repudiation agreements and reseller transactions. VimpelCom also failed to implement and enforce adequate internal accounting controls, which allowed the bribe payments to occur without detection or remediation. Moreover, when the board of directors sought an FCPA legal opinion assessing corruption risks involved in the transactions, certain VimpelCom management withheld crucial information from outside counsel performing the review that restricted the scope of FCPA opinions, rendering them worthless. Rather than implement and enforce a strong anticorruption ethic, certain VimpelCom executives sought ways to give the company plausible deniability of illegality while knowingly proceeding with corrupt business transactions.\" (Source: US Department of Justice Press Release, \"VimpelCom Limited and Unitel LLC Enter into Global Foreign Bribery Resolution of More Than $795 Million\u037e United States Seeks $850 Million Forfeiture in Corrupt Proceeds of Bribery Scheme,\" February 18, 2016.)

        "Summary": "According to the US Department of Justice, \"Weatherford Services Limited (Weatherford Services), a subsidiary of Weatherford International, today agreed to plead guilty to violating the anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA. As part of a coordinated FCPA resolution, the department today also filed a criminal information in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas charging Weatherford International with one count of violating the internal controls provisions of the FCPA. To resolve the charge, Weatherford International has agreed to pay an $87.2 million criminal penalty as part of a deferred prosecution agreement with the department. [ ] \r\n  \r\n In a separate matter, Weatherford International and four of its subsidiaries today agreed to pay a combined $100 million to resolve a criminal and administrative export controls investigation conducted by the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Southern District of Texas, the Department of Commerce\u2019s Bureau of Industry and Security, and the Department of the Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control. As part of the resolution of that investigation, Weatherford International has agreed to enter into a deferred prosecution agreement for a term of two years and two of its subsidiaries have agreed to plead guilty to export controls charges. [ ] \r\n  \r\n The combined investigations resulted in the conviction of three Weatherford subsidiaries, the entry by Weatherford International into two deferred prosecution agreements and a civil settlement, and the payment of a total of $252,690,606 in penalties and fines. \r\n \r\n FCPA Violations\r\n \r\n According to court documents filed by the department, prior to 2008, Weatherford International knowingly failed to establish an effective system of internal accounting controls designed to detect and prevent corruption, including FCPA violations. The company failed to implement these internal controls despite operating in an industry with a substantial corruption risk profile and despite growing its global footprint in large part by purchasing existing companies, often themselves in countries with high corruption risks. As a result, a permissive and uncontrolled environment existed within which employees of certain of Weatherford International\u2019s wholly owned subsidiaries in Africa and the Middle East were able to engage in corrupt conduct over the course of many years, including both bribery of foreign officials and fraudulent misuse of the United Nations\u2019 Oil for Food Program.\r\n \r\n Court documents state that Weatherford Services employees established and operated a joint venture in Africa with two local entities controlled by foreign officials and their relatives from 2004 through at least 2008. The foreign officials selected the entities with which Weatherford Services would partner, and Weatherford Services and Weatherford International employees knew that the members of the local entities included foreign officials\u2019 relatives and associates. Notwithstanding the fact that the local entities did not contribute capital, expertise or labor to the joint venture, neither Weatherford Services nor Weatherford International investigated why the local entities were involved in the joint venture. The sole purpose of those local entities, in fact, was to serve as conduits through which Weatherford Services funneled hundreds of thousands of dollars in payments to the foreign officials controlling them. In exchange for the payments they received from Weatherford Services through the joint venture, the foreign officials awarded the joint venture lucrative contracts, gave Weatherford Services inside information about competitors\u2019 pricing, and took contracts away from Weatherford Services\u2019 competitors and awarded them to the joint venture.\r\n \r\n Additionally, Weatherford Services employees in Africa bribed a foreign official so that he would approve the renewal of an oil services contract, according to court documents. Weatherford Services funneled bribery payments to the foreign official through a freight forwarding agent it retained via a consultancy agreement in July 2006. Weatherford Services generated sham purchase orders for consulting services the freight forwarding agent never performed, and the freight forwarding agent, in turn, generated sham invoices for those same nonexistent services. When paid for those invoices, the freight forwarding agent passed at least some of those monies on to the foreign official with the authority to approve Weatherford Services\u2019 contract renewal. In exchange for these payments, the foreign official awarded the renewal contract to Weatherford Services in 2006.\r\n \r\n Further, according to court documents, in a third scheme in the Middle East, from 2005 through 2011, employees of Weatherford Oil Tools Middle East Limited (WOTME), another Weatherford International subsidiary, awarded improper \u201cvolume discounts\u201d to a distributor who supplied Weatherford International products to a government-owned national oil company, believing that those discounts were being used to create a slush fund with which to make bribe payments to decision-makers at the national oil company. Between 2005 and 2011, WOTME paid approximately $15 million in volume discounts to the distributor.\"(Source: US DOJ Press Release, \"Three Subsidiaries of Weatherford International Limited Agree to Plead Guilty to FCPA and Export Control Violations,\" November 26, 2013.)",

        "Summary": "According to the US Securities and Exchange Commission, Weatherford International, an oil services company's \"misconduct occurred from at least 2002 to 2011. In Angola, for example, Weatherford\u2019s legal department permitted its subsidiary to use an agent who insisted that an FCPA clause be omitted from the consultancy agreement. The company took no steps to determine whether the agent was paying bribes to foreign officials, and the agent used sham work orders and invoices to pay bribes that ensured the renewal of a lucrative oil services contract for Weatherford in Angola. The same agent made illicit payments to obtain commercial contracts for Weatherford in Congo. The company also allowed its subsidiary to enter into a joint venture agreement with companies whose beneficial owners included Angolan oil company officials and a relative of an Angolan Minister in order to win business. A Weatherford employee reported in a 2006 ethics questionnaire that Weatherford personnel were making payments to government officials in Angola and elsewhere, but the company failed to investigate. \r\n \r\n The SEC\u2019s complaint also alleges that Weatherford failed to perform due diligence on a distributor suggested by an official at a national oil company in the Middle East. From 2005 to 2011, Weatherford and its subsidiaries awarded more than $11.8 million in improper \u201cvolume discounts\u201d to the distributor \u2013 money intended for the creation of a slush fund to pay foreign officials. \r\n \r\n According to the SEC\u2019s complaint, the misconduct went beyond the use of agents or other third parties. Weatherford provided improper travel and entertainment to officials of a state-owned company in Algeria with no legitimate business purpose. For example, Weatherford paid for a 2006 FIFA World Cup trip by two of the officials, the July 2006 honeymoon of an official\u2019s daughter, and an October 2005 religious trip to Saudi Arabia by an official and his family that was improperly recorded as a donation in Weatherford\u2019s books and records. Weatherford\u2019s Middle East subsidiary also made more than $1.4 million in improper payments to obtain nine contracts under the Oil-for-Food program in 2002. Iraqi ministries demanded improper \u201cinland transportation fees\u201d in an effort to subvert the UN program. Weatherford\u2019s subsidiary complied with the Iraqi demands and paid more than $115,000 in fees despite invoices that included charges inconsistent with the actual deliveries. Weatherford obtained more than $7 million in profits from the misconduct.\r\n \r\n The SEC further alleges that managers at Weatherford\u2019s subsidiary in Italy flouted the lack of internal controls and misappropriated more than $200,000 in company funds, some of which was improperly paid to Albanian tax auditors. The managers misreported cash advances, diverted payments on previously paid invoices, misappropriated government rebate checks, and received reimbursement for such purchases as golf equipment and perfume that did not relate to business activities. \r\n \r\n According to the SEC\u2019s complaint, Weatherford employees created false accounting and inventory records from 2002 to 2007 to hide the illegal commercial sales to Cuba, Syria, Sudan, and Iran. During this time period, exporting or re-exporting goods or services from the U.S. to these sanctioned countries was prohibited. The falsified financial statements and books and records of Weatherford subsidiaries involved in the misconduct were consolidated into the financial statements of the parent company.\" (Source: SEC Press Release, \"SEC Charges Weatherford International With FCPA Violations,\" November 26, 2013.)\r\n \r\n According to the Judgment in the case, the company \"is liable for disgorgement of $90,984,844 representing profits gained as a result of the conduct alleged in the Complaint, together with prejUdgment interest thereon in the amount of $4,399,423.34 for a total of $95,384,267.34 (\"disgorgement obligation\").
